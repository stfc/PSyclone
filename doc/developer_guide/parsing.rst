Parsing Code
############

The PSyclone `parse` module is responsible for parsing science
(algorithm and kernel) code and extracting the required information
for the algorithm translation and PSy generation phases.

The `parse` module contains modules for parsing algorithm
(`algorithm.py`) and kernel (`kernel.py`) code as well as a utility
module (`utils.py`) for common functionality.

Parsing Algorithm Code
======================

The first thing PSyclone typically does is parse an input file. This
input file is expected to contain Fortran source code conforming to
the particular API in question. For the `nemo` API this is standard
code, for the other API's this is algorithm code (conforming to the
PSyKAl separation of concerns). The PSyclone code to do this is found
in `parse/algorithm.py`.

An input file can be parsed via the `parse` function or via an
instance of the `Parser` class. In practice the `parse` function
simply calls the `Parser` class so we will concentrate on the latter
in this section. The `parse` function could be removed from PSyclone
but it is simple and is used in existing PSyclone scripts and
examples.

The `Parser` class is initialised with a number of optional
arguments. A particular `api` can be specified (this is required so
the parser knows what sort of code and metadata to expect, how to
parse it and which `built-ins` are supported). The name used to specify
an invoke (defaulting to `invoke`) can be changed, a path to where to
look for associated kernel files can be provided and a particular
maximum line length can be specified.

.. autoclass:: psyclone.parse.algorithm.Parser

Once an instance of the `Parser()` class is created and configured
with required values for the optional arguments, then the parse method
can be called. This takes the name of the input code as its argument
and returns a parse tree of the input code and a FileInfo object that
captures the required invoke information found in the input code and
in the associated kernel codes.

If the `nemo` API is specified then the `parse` method of the `Parser`
instance simply parses the code with `fparser2` and returns the
resultant `fparser2` parse tree.

For all other APIs the `parse` method of the `Parser` instance returns
the resultant `fparser2` parse tree and a `FileInfo` instance which
captures the invoke and kernel metadata in a hierarchy of classes.

When the `Parser` instance parses the code it expects to find Fortran
code containing a program, module, subroutine or function (and it
aborts if not). Currently the first of these (there may be more than
one subroutine for example) is assumed to be the one that is
required. This limititation is captured in issue #307.

The native `fparser2` tree of the Fortran code is then walked and all
use statement names are captured and stored in a map (called
`_arg_name_to_module_name`). This map allows the module name to be
found given a particular argument name. Also, if an `invoke` call is
found then an `InvokeCall` object is created and added to a list of
such instances. Once all invokes have been found the `FileInfo`
instance is created.

.. note:: In the future we want to be able to simply replace one parse
          tree with another. So how should we do this? One option
          would be to try to minimise the parser-specific parts and
          create some form of interface. The question is really what
          level of interface we should use.

An `InvokeCall` object is created in the `create_invoke_call` method
by first parsing each of the kernels specified in an invoke call and
creating a list of `kernel` objects which are then used to create
an `InvokeCall`. These objects capture information on the way each
kernel is being called from the Algorithm layer.

A `kernel` object is created in the `create_kernel_call` method which
extracts the kernel name and kernel arguments, then creates either an
`algorithm.BuiltInCall` instance (via the `create_builtin_kernel_call`
method) or an `algorithm.KernelCall` instance (via the
`create_coded_kernel_call` method). `BuiltInCalls` are created if the
kernel name is the same as one of those specified in the built-in names
for this particular API (see the variable `_builtin_name_map` which is
initialised by the `get_builtin_defs` function).

The `create_kernel_call` method uses the `get_kernel` function to find
out the kernel name and create a list of `Arg` instances representing
the arguments. The `get_kernel` function parses each kernel argument
using the fparser2 AST and determines the required argument
information. An advantage of `fparser2` when compared with `fparser1`
is that it parses all of a code, so we can use the parse tree to
determine the type of each kernel argument appearing in the `invoke`
call (e.g. scalar variable, array reference, literal constant) and
create the appropriate `Arg` instance. Previously we relied on the
`expression` module to do this (which has limitations).

.. note:: the analysis in the `get_kernel` function is the place to
          extend if we were to support arithmetic operations in an
          invoke call.

Parsing Kernel Code (Metadata)
==============================

An `algorithm.BuiltInCall` instance is created by being passed a
`kernel.BuiltinKernelType` instance for the particular API via the
`BuiltInKernelTypeFactory` class which is found in the `parse.kernels`
module. This class parses the Fortran module file which specifies
built-in description metadata. Currently `fparser1` is used but we will
be migrating to `fparser2` in the future. The built-in metadata is
specified in the same form as coded kernel metadata so the same logic
can be used (i.e. the `KernelTypeFactory.create` method is called)
which is why `BuiltInKernelTypeFactory` subclasses
`KernelTypeFactory`.

An `algorithm.KernelCall` instance is created by being passed the
module name of the kernel and a `kernel.KernelType` instance for the
particular API via the `KernelTypeFactory` class which is also found
in the `parse.kernel` module. This class is given the parsed kernel
module (via the `get_kernel_ast` function - which searches for the
kernel file using the kernel path information introduced
earlier). Again, currently `fparser1` is used but we will be migrating
to `fparser2` in the future.

The `KernelTypeFactory create` method is used for both coded kernels
and built-in kernels to specify the API-specific class to use. As an
example, in the case of the `dynamo0.3` API, the class is
`DynKernMetadata` which is found in `psyclone.dynamo0p3`. Once this
instance has been created (by passing it an `fparser1` parse tree) it can
return information about the metadata contained therein. Moving from
`fparser1` to `fparser2` would required changing the parse code logic
in each of the API-specific classes.
