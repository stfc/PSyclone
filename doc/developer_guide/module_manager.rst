Module Manager
##############

PSyclone uses a ``ModuleManager`` to handle searching for files containing
Fortran modules. This object acts as the top-level interface to the
code making up a program. It may be used to obtain the PSyIR for each
Container (Fortran module) in a code. It is used by the Container import
interface and the :ref:`psyke`. For the latter it
is used
to discover all of the source files required to make a standalone driver.

The :ref_guide:`ModuleManager psyclone.parse.html#psyclone.parse.ModuleManager`
is a singleton which must be obtained via
`ModuleManager.get()`. Having obtained the instance, it may be used to
search for a particular module via the `get_module_info` method:

.. automethod:: psyclone.parse.ModuleManager.get_module_info

Any PSyclone command line option ``-d`` (see :ref:`psyclone_command`)
will be added to the ``ModuleManager`` as recursive search
paths. Internally, the ``ModuleManager`` uses caching to avoid
repeatedly searching directories, and it will only access search paths
as required. For example, if it should happen that the first search
path is sufficient to find all modules during the lifetime of the
module manager, no other search path will ever be accessed.  The
caching also implies that the ModuleManager will *not* detect any new
files created during its lifetime.

Rather than rely on any particular naming convention to identify which
Fortran source file contains a given module, a measure of the
'similarity' of the target module name and the base name (i.e. the
filename stripped of any path and suffix) of any source file is used
to identify likely candidates. The standard Python
``difflib.SequenceMatcher.ratio`` method is used to obtain the
similarity score. If the score is above a certain threshold (currently
set to 0.7 in the ``ModuleManager`` class) then the file is read, its
contents cached within a :ref_guide:`FileInfo
psyclone.parse.html#psyclone.parse.FileInfo` object, and a regular
expression used to determine whether or not it does contain the target
module. This approach has been designed to minimise IO activity since
this could get very costly on the types of shared filesystem common on
HPC resources. The use of a ``FileInfo`` object also facilitates the
decoupling of the concept of a file from that of a module since the
former can contain more than one of the latter.

The ``ModuleManager`` will return a :ref_guide:`ModuleInfo
psyclone.parse.html#psyclone.parse.ModuleInfo` object to make
information about a module available.
Similar to the ``ModuleManager``, a ``ModuleInfo`` object relies heavily on
caching to avoid repeatedly reading a source file or parsing it. The side
effect is that changes to a source file during the lifetime of the
``ModuleManager`` will not be reflected in its information.

The ``ModuleManager`` also provides a static function that will sort
a list of module dependencies, so that compiling the modules in this order
(or adding them in this order to a file) will allow compilation, i.e. any
module will only depend on previously defined modules:

.. automethod:: psyclone.parse.ModuleManager.sort_modules

Once a ``ModuleInfo`` has been obtained, its primary role is to provide
access to the PSyIR of the ``Container`` representing the module:

.. automethod:: psyclone.parse.ModuleInfo.get_psyir

However, it also provides methods (``get_used_modules``,
``get_used_symbols_from_modules``) for interrogating the parse tree which
can be useful if it is not possible to represent this in PSyIR.

An example usage of the ``ModuleManager`` and ``ModuleInfo`` objects,
which prints the filenames of all modules used in ``tl_testkern_mod``:

.. testcode ::

    mod_manager = ModuleManager.get()
    # Add the path to the PSyclone LFRic example codes:
    mod_manager.add_search_path("../../src/psyclone/tests/test_files/"
                                "dynamo0p3")

    testkern_info = mod_manager.get_module_info("tl_testkern_mod")

    used_mods = testkern_info.get_used_modules()
    # Sort the modules so we get a reproducible output ordering
    used_mods_list = sorted(list(used_mods))
    for module_name in used_mods_list:
        mod_info = mod_manager.get_module_info(module_name)
        print("Module:", module_name, os.path.basename(mod_info.filename))

.. testoutput::

    Module: argument_mod argument_mod.f90
    Module: constants_mod constants_mod.f90
    Module: fs_continuity_mod fs_continuity_mod.f90
    Module: kernel_mod kernel_mod.f90
