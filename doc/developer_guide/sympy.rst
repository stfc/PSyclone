SymPy
=====
PSyclone uses the symbolic maths package "SymPy" for comparing
expressions symbolically, e.g. a comparison like ``i+j > i+j-1``
will be evaluated to be true.

The SymPy package is wrapped in the PSyclone class ``SymbolicMaths``:

.. autoclass:: psyclone.core.SymbolicMaths
    :members:

This can be used for tests of nodes in the PSyIR. For example,
the NEMO loop fuse transformation checks that the loops to
be fused have the same loop boundaries using code like this:

.. testcode::

  from psyclone.core import SymbolicMaths
  from psyclone.psyir.backend.fortran import FortranWriter

  # Assume loop1 is ``do i=1, k`` and loop2 ``do i=5+k-4-k, 2*k-k-1``.

  writer = FortranWriter()
  sym_maths = SymbolicMaths.get()
  if sym_maths.equal(loop1.start_expr, loop2.start_expr):
      print(f"'{writer(loop1.start_expr)}' equals "
            f"'{writer(loop2.start_expr)}'")
  if not sym_maths.equal(loop1.stop_expr, loop2.stop_expr):
      print(f"'{writer(loop1.stop_expr)}' does not equal "
            f"'{ writer(loop2.stop_expr)}'")

.. testoutput::

    '1' equals '5 + k - 4 - k'
    'k' does not equal '2 * k - k - 1'

SymPyWriter - Converting PSyIR to SymPy
---------------------------------------
The methods of the SymbolicMaths class expect to be passed PSyIR nodes.
They convert these expressions first into strings before parsing
them as SymPy expressions. The conversion is done with the ``SymPyWriter``
class, and it is the task of the ``SymPyWriter`` to convert the PSyIR
into a form that can be understood by SymPy. Several Fortran constructs
need to be converted in order to work with SymPy. The SymPy writer mostly
uses the Fortran writer for creating a string for the PSyIR, but implements
the following features to allow the parsing of the expressions by SymPy:

Array Accesses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Any array access is declared as a SymPy unknown function and any scalar
access as a SymPy symbol. These declarations are stored in a
dictionary, which is used by the parser of SymPy to ensure the correct
interpretation of any names found in the expression. Note that while
SymPy has the concept of ``Indexed`` expressions, they do not work well
when solving equations that requires the comparison of indices (which is
frequently needed for the dependency analysis). For example,
``M[x] - M[1] == 0`` does not result in the solution ``x=1`` when ``M``
is an indexed SymPy type. Using an unknown function on the other hand
handles this as expected.

.. _array_expressions:

Array Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each array index will be converted into three arguments for the corresponding
unknown SymPy function that represents the array access. For example, an array
expression ``a(i:j:k)`` will become
``a(i, j, k)``, and to then maintain the same number of arguments for
each use of an array/function, ``a(i)`` will become ``a(i,i,1)``, and
``b(i,j)`` becomes ``b(i,i,1,j,j,1)`` etc. Array expressions like ``a(:)``
will be using specific names for the lower and upper bound, defaulting
to ``sympy_lower`` and ``sympy_upper``. So the previous expression
becomes ``a(sympy_lower, sympy_upper, 1)``. Note that in case of a name
clash SymPyWriter will change the names of the boundaries to be unique.

Fortran-specific Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
No precision or kind information is added to a constant (e.g. a Fortran
value like ``2_4`` will be written just as ``2``). The intrinsic functions
``Max``, ``Min``, ``Mod`` are capitalised to be recognised by SymPy which
is case sensitive.

User-defined Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SymPy has no concept of user-defined types like
``a(i)%b`` in Fortran. But this case is not handled especially, the
PSyIR is converted to Fortran syntax and is provided unmodified to SymPy.
SymPy interprets the ``%`` symbol
as modulo function, so the expression above is read as ``Mod(a(i), b)``.
This interpretation achieves the expected outcome when comparing structures
and array references.
For example, ``a(i+2*j-1)%b(k-i)`` and ``a(j*2-1+i)%b(-i+k)`` will be
considered to be equal:

1. Converting the two expressions to SymPy internally results in
   ``Mod(a(i+2*j-1), b(k-i))`` and ``Mod(a(j*2-1+i, b(-i+k))``.
2. Since nothing is known about the arguments of any of the ``Mod``
   functions, SymPy will first detect that the same function is called
   in both expression, and then continue to compare the arguments of
   this function.
3. The first arguments are ``a(i+2*j-1)`` and ``a(j*2-1+i)``.
   The name ``a`` is considered an unknown function. SymPy detects
   that both expressions appear to call the same function, and it
   will therefore compare the arguments.
4. SymPy compares ``i+2*j-1`` and ``j*2-1+i`` symbolically, and
   evaluate these expressions to be identical. Therefore, the
   two expressions ``a(...)`` are identical, so the first arguments
   of the ``Mod`` function are identical.
5. Similarly, it will then continue to evaluate the second argument
   of the ``Mod`` function (``b(...)``), and evaluate them to be
   identical.
6. Since all arguments of the ``Mod`` function are identical,
   SymPy will report these two functions to be the same, which
   is the expected outcome.

A member of a structure in Fortran becomes a stand-alone symbol (or
function if it is an array) in SymPy. The SymPy
writer will rename members to better indicate that they are members:
an expression like ``a%b%c`` will be written as ``a%a_b%a_b_c``, which
SymPy then parses as ``MOD(a, MOD(a_b, a_b_c))``. This convention
makes it easier to identify what the various expressions in SymPy are.

This handling of member variables can result in name clashes. Consider
the expression ``a%b + a_b + b``. The structure access will be using
two symbols ``a`` and ``a_b`` - but now there are two different symbols
with the same name. Note that the renaming of the member from ``b`` to
``a_b`` is not the reason for this - without renaming the same clash would
happen with the symbol ``b``.

The SymPy writer uses a symbol table to make sure it creates unique symbols.
It first adds all References in the expression to the symbol table, which
guarantees that no Reference to an existing symbol is renamed. The writer
then renames all members and makes sure it uses a unique name. In the case of
``a%b + a_b + b``, it would create ``a%a_b_1 + a_b + b``, using the name
``a_b_1`` for the member to avoid the name clash with the reference
``a_b`` - so an existing Reference will not be renamed, only members.

.. note:: At this stage an expression using user-defined types cannot be
    converted back to a PSyIR (which is what
    `psyclone.core.SymbolicMaths.expand` does as a final step). This is
    tracked as issue #2166.


Documentation for SymPyWriter Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SymPyWriter provides the following functions:

.. autoclass:: psyclone.psyir.backend.sympy_writer.SymPyWriter
    :members:
    :special-members: __new__

SymPyReader - Converting SymPy to PSyIr
---------------------------------------
The ``SymPyReader`` converts a SymPy expression back to PSyIR. Together
with the SymPyWriter it allows to take a PSyIR expression, manipulate
it with SymPy, and creating a new PSyIR that can be used.
The SymPyReader is closely connected to the SymPyWriter: as explained
in :ref:`array_expressions` the SymPyWriter creates special symbols
to indicate the lower- and upper-bound of an array expression. In order
to convert these arguments back to the corresponding Fortran representation,
the SymPyReader needs to know the actual names (which might have been
changed from their default because of a name clash with a user variable).
The SymPyReader constructor therefore takes a SymPyWriter as argument,
and it is the responsibility of the user to make sure the provided
SymPyWriter instance is indeed the one used to create the SymPy expressions
in the first place.

An example of converting an expression `expr` from PSyIR to SymPy and back:

.. testcode::

    from sympy import expand
    from psyclone.psyir.backend.fortran import FortranWriter
    from psyclone.psyir.backend.sympy_writer import SymPyWriter
    from psyclone.psyir.frontend.sympy_reader import SymPyReader

    sympy_writer = SymPyWriter()
    sympy_expr = sympy_writer(expr)

    # Use SymPy to modify the expression ...
    new_expr = expand(sympy_expr)

    # Find the required symbol table in the original PSyIR
    symbol_table = expr.scope.symbol_table

    sympy_reader = SymPyReader(sympy_writer)
    # Convert the new sympy expression to PSyIR
    new_psyir_expr = sympy_reader.psyir_from_expression(new_expr, symbol_table)

    writer = FortranWriter()
    print(f"{writer(expr)} = {writer(new_psyir_expr)}")

.. testoutput::

     (j + 1) * k = j * k + k
