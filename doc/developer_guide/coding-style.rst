Coding and Documentation Style
******************************

Documentation Style
###################
When writing documentation, each reference to a PSyclone class or function
should be set in italics (i.e. enclosed by single backticks) except in headings.
The first time a class or function is mentioned, use the full Python path, e.g.:
`psyclone.core.signature.Signature`. After that just use the
class name (again in italics).
File names and shell commands should be set in double back-ticks (\`\`).

Any code examples provided in the documentation should be using the
right syntax to allow for syntax highlighting. The option
``.. highlight:: LANGUAGE`` is used to define the language to be used
for all text following the directive (until the end of the current file).
It is recommended to have at most one ``highlight`` directive in
a file and to avoid switching default languages several times within a file.
Having a default language set in a file allows use of the very convenient
shortcut notation "::". Note that the "::" will be replaced with a
single ":" if the previous character is not a space::

    .. highlight:: fortran

    Code example::

        program this_is_highlighted_using_fortran_syntax

    And if you don't want any ":" in the previous line, just
    add a white space before the "::" ::

        program there_is_no_colon_in_the_previous_description

If some examples in a file need a different highlighting syntax,
use the ``.. code-block:: LANGUAGE`` directive, which will only
change the syntax for the following code example::

    .. highlight:: fortran

    Code example::

        program this_is_highlighted_using_fortran_syntax

    This is a python example:

    .. code-block:: python

        trans = self.get_transform()


It is also possible to use ``code-block`` inside a Python docstring that
is pulled into a document::


    class GOConstLoopBoundsTrans(Transformation):
        ''' Switch on (or off) the use of constant loop bounds within
        a GOInvokeSchedule. In the absence of constant loop bounds, PSyclone will
        generate loops where the bounds are obtained by de-referencing a field
        object, e.g.:

        .. code-block:: fortran

          DO j = my_field%grid%internal%ystart, my_field%grid%internal%ystop

        Some compilers are able to produce more efficient code if they are
        ...

The code block will be highlighted as Fortran code.

Coding Style
############
Any new PSyclone code must confirm to Python's pep8 specification, and
must be pylint error and warning free. Installation of the tools is
described in :ref:`system_specific_dev_setup`. 
In some cases pylint errors and warnings can be suppressed using the
pylint markup code::

    # pylint: disable=too-many-branches
    def _upper_bound(self):
        ....

It is up to the developer to decide if code should be refactored to
avoid a warning. For example, a warning about too many local
variables in a function might be better suppressed instead of 
removing one variable, or refactoring the code to create two functions.

Additional rules that apply:

  #) All setter and getter functions (that do not do any significant work)
     must be declared as property and setter to allow them to be used
     without parentheses::

        @property
        def ast_end(self):
            '''
            :returns: a reference to the last node in the fparser2 parse tree \
                      that represents a child of this PSyIR node or None.
            :rtype: sub-class of :py:class:`fparser.two.utils.Base`
            '''
            return self._ast_end

        @ast.setter
        def ast(self, ast):
            '''
            Set a reference to the fparser2 node associated with this Node.
                   :param ast: fparser2 node associated with this Node.
            :type ast: :py:class:`fparser.two.utils.Base`
            '''
            self._ast = ast

  #) Any function must contain an interface description, see
     :ref:`interface_description` for full details..
  #) Any new line of code must be covered by at least one test case,
     see :ref:`test_suite` and especially :ref:`test_coverage`.

  #) Importing other modules should be done at the top of a file, and
     the import statements must be sorted alphabetically. If a
     module cannot be import at the top of a file due to a circular
     dependency, a comment must be added to the local import statement,
     and the corresponding pylint warning must be disabled, e.g.::

         def my_function():
             ...
             # Avoid circular import
             # pylint: disable=import-outside-toplevel
             from psyclone.core.access_type import AccessType


Exceptions
----------

When raising an exception, every effort must be made to ensure that
the associated message is clear and provides as much information as
possible. However, it should *not* contain the name of the current
routine/class etc. as this is provided in the Python stack trace.
Where it makes sense to do so, the past tense should be used,
e.g. "expected a str but got an object of type 'blah'."

In the event that code that is handling an exception then needs to
raise a new exception, the `raise XXX from YYY` form must be used.
(This ensures that contextual information about the source of the error is
retained.). For example::

    try:
        something()
    except KeyError as err:
        raise InternalError("Useful message here") from err

.. _interface_description:

Interface Description
#####################


The interface to any new or modified routine in PSyclone must be fully
documented using Sphinx mark-up. An example of how to do this is shown below:

    .. literalinclude:: interface_example.py

Example layout of the interface description above: 

.. autofunction:: interface_example.some_function

Some important details:

  #) There are up to four major sections in each interface description: function
     description, parameter description and type, return value and type, and
     raises (exceptions). The function description is required, all other
     sections only need be provided if they are applicable for the code being
     documented. The formatting for each section is slightly different:

         .. tabularcolumns:: |l|L|
         
         ===================== ======================================================
         Section               Formatting
         ===================== ======================================================
         function description  The description of the function must start with
                               a capital letter, and end with a full stop.
         parameter description Start the parameter description with a lowercase 
                               letter and end with a full stop. The parameter type
                               declaration must follow `PEP 483
			       <https://peps.python.org/pep-0483/>`_ with no
			       punctuation at the end. References to other
                               classes within PSyclone should be written as
                               ``:py:class:`psyclone.filename.Class```.
         return value          The description of the return value should start with
                               a lowercase letter, and end with a full stop. The type
                               must follow `PEP 483
			       <https://peps.python.org/pep-0483/>`_.
         exceptions            These must start with a lower case letter, and end
                               with a full stop.
         ===================== ======================================================


  #) If a parameter description, type, return value or exception is continued
     to the next line, there must be a '\\\\' continuation symbol at the end of
     each line. Align each continued line with the column at which the
     description begins on the previous line. If this would create lines that
     are too short then the first continued line may be indented less, e.g.::

         '''
         :param some_very_long_variable_name: this is some argument that has \
		a very long name and therefore it does not make sense to indent \
		continued lines to align with the start of the description.
	 '''
  #) If an argument type is a Python built-in (e.g. str, int or bool) then the
     type can be specified in-line with the argument description. However, if it
     is of a derived type then, for clarity, it should be specified in a
     separate :type my_arg: line.
  #) The closing \\'\\'\\' of the interface description can be at the end of a
     text line if the overall description is short. Otherwise it should be on a
     separate line. An optional empty line between interface description and
     code should be included in the comment section.

  #) Standard Python functions like `__str__` etc. need only be documented with a
     simple informal comment.

  #) Only document exceptions that are raised directly by a method, not exceptions
     that might be raised in base classes.

File Names and Directory Layout
################################
Any file in PSyclone should only contain one main class (helper classes or functions
specific to that class are of course possible). While the class name should start
with a capital letter and be in camel-case (`ExtractTrans`), the corresponding
file name should be derived from the class name by replacing all upper case letters
with lower case, and adding a '_' to separate words. So the file containing
the class `ExtractTrans` should be called `extract_trans.py`.

The directory structure of the PSyclone classes is as follows:

domain:
    This directory contains the various API-specific classes.

    domain/API_NAME:
        The following domains are currently supported: `lfric`, `gocean`, `nemo`.

        domain/API_NAME/transformations:
            These directories contain the API-specific transformations,
            typically using one of the classes in psyir/transformations as a base
            class. Any transformation class should have the domain as prefix, and
            `Trans` as postfix (e.g. `GOceanExtractTrans`), and the corresponding
            file name should start with the API name and end with `_trans.py`
            (e.g. `gocean_extract_trans.py`).

psyir:
    This directory contains all classes and functions related to the PSyIR
    (PSyclone Internal Representation). The directory itself does not contain
    any source files (except `__init__.py` to shorten the import paths).

    psyir/transformations
        This directory contains all basic transformations, i.e. all transformations
        that are either directly usable in any API, or are base classes for
        API-specific transformations. Any transformation class should have `Trans`
        as postfix (e.g. `ExtractTrans`), and the corresponding file name should
        end with `_trans.py` (e.g. `extract_trans.py`).
