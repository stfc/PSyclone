PSyclone User Guide
=====================


.. only:: html

    PSyclone is a code generation system developed to support domain-specific
    languages (DSLs) for finite element, finite volume and finite difference
    codes. Notably, it is used in the
    `LFRic Project <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/modelling-systems/
    lfric/>`_, and it also supports the
    `GOcean <https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=NE%2FL01209X%2F1>`_
    (2D, finite difference) DSL. In addition it is being extended
    to support the processing of existing finite difference codes such as the 
    `NEMO <https://www.nemo-ocean.eu/>`_ ocean model. 
    Find more information in the
    `Developer's Guide <https://psyclone-dev.readthedocs.io/>`_
    and the
    `Reference Guide <https://psyclone-ref.readthedocs.io/>`_.
