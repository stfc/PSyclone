PSyclone User Guide
=====================

PSyclone is a source-to-source Fortran compiler designed to programmatically
optimise, parallelise and instrument HPC applications via user-provided
transformation scripts.

By encapsulating the performance-portability aspects (e.g. whether to
parallelise with OpenMP or OpenACC), these scripts enable a separation of
concerns between the scientific implementation and the optimisation choices.
This allows each aspect to be explored and developed largely independently.
Additionally, PSyclone supports the development of kernel-based, Fortran-embedded
DSLs following the PSyKAl model developed in the
`GungHo project <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/foundation/dynamics/next-generation>`_.

PSyclone is currently used to support the
`LFRic <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/modelling-systems/lfric/>`_
mixed finite-element PSyKAl DSL for the UK MetOffice's next generation
modelling system and the
`GOcean <https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=NE%2FL01209X%2F1>`_
finite-difference PSyKAl DSL for a prototype 2D ocean modelling system.
It is also used to insert GPU offloading directives into existing
directly-addressed MPI applications such as the
`NEMO ocean model <https://www.nemo-ocean.eu/>`_.

More detailed implementation information is available in the
`Developer Guide <https://psyclone-dev.readthedocs.io/>`_
and the
`Reference Guide <https://psyclone-ref.readthedocs.io/>`_.
