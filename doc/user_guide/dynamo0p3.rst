Dynamo0.3 API
=============

This section describes the Dynamo0.3 application programming interface
(API). This API explains what a user needs to write in order to make
use of the Dynamo0.3 API in PSyclone.

As with the majority of PSyclone APIs, the Dynamo0.3 API specifies
how a user needs to write the algorithm layer and the kernel layer to
allow PSyclone to generate the PSy layer. These algorithm and kernel
APIs are discussed separately in the following sections.

The Dynamo0.3 API supports the Met Office's finite element (hereafter FEM)
based GungHo dynamical core (see :ref:`introduction`). The Met Office
Collaboration Wiki (login required) provides more detailed information
about the dynamical core's `formulation
<http://collab.metoffice.gov.uk/twiki/bin/viewfile/Static/LFRic/lfric-gungho-meto-spice/documentation/design/dynamo_formulation.pdf>`_
and `data model
<http://collab.metoffice.gov.uk/twiki/bin/viewfile/Static/LFRic/lfric-gungho-meto-spice/documentation/design/dynamo_datamodel.pdf>`_.

.. _dynamo0.3-api-algorithm:

Algorithm
---------

The general requirements for the structure of an Algorithm are explained
in the :ref:`algorithm-layer` section. This section explains the
Dynamo0.3-API-specific specialisations and extensions.

.. _dynamo0.3-example:

Example
+++++++

An example Dynamo0.3 API invoke call is given below with various
different types of objects supported by the API. These different
objects and their use are discussed in the following sections.

::

  real(kind=r_def)           :: scalar1
  integer(kind=i_def)        :: stencil_extent
  type(field_type)           :: field1, field2, field3
  type(field_type)           :: field5(3), field6(3)
  type(quadrature_type)      :: qr
  type(operator_type)        :: operator1
  type(columnwise_operator_type) :: cma_op1
  ...
  call invoke( kernel1(field1, field2, operator1, qr),           &
               builtin1(scalar1, field2, field3),                &
               kernel2(field1, stencil_extent, field3, scalar1), &
               assembly_kernel(cma_op1, operator1),              &
               name="some_calculation"                           &
             )
  call invoke( prolong_kernel_type(field1, field4),              &
               restrict_kernel_type(field5, field6)
             )

Please see the :ref:`algorithm-layer` section for a description of the
``name`` argument.

Objects in the Dynamo0.3 API can be categorised by their functionality
as data types and information that specifies supported operations on a
particular data type. The above example introduces four of five data types
supported by the Dynamo0.3 API: field, scalar, operator and column-wise
operator (field vector is the fifth). ``qr`` represents a quadrature
object which provides information required by a kernel to operate
on fields (see section :ref:`dynamo0.3-quadrature` for more details).

.. _dynamo0.3-field:

Field
+++++

Dynamo0.3 API fields, identified with ``GH_FIELD`` metadata, represent
FEM discretisations of various dynamical core prognostic and diagnostic
variables. In FEM, variables are discretised by placing them into a
function space (see :ref:`dynamo0.3-function-space`) from which they
inherit a polynomial expansion via the basis functions of that space.
Field values at points within a cell are evaluated as the sum of a set
of basis functions multiplied by coefficients which are the data points.
Points of evaluation are determined by a quadrature object
(:ref:`dynamo0.3-quadrature`) and are independent of the function space
the field is on. Placement of field data points, also called degrees of
freedom (hereafter "DoFs"), is determined by the function space the field
is on.

.. _dynamo0.3-field-vector:

Field Vector
++++++++++++

Depending on the function space a field lives on, the field data at a
point can be a scalar or a vector (see :ref:`dynamo0.3-function-space`
for the list of scalar and vector function spaces). There is an
additional option which specifies whether the data itself is vector
valued and it usually refers to bundles of scalar valued fields.
Field vectors are represented as ``GH_FIELD*N`` where ``N`` is the
size of the vector. The 3D coordinate field, for example, has
``(x, y, z)`` scalar values at the nodes and therefore has a
vector size of 3.

Scalar
++++++

In Dynamo0.3 API a scalar is a single value variable that can be
either real or integer. Real scalars are identified with ``GH_REAL``
and integer scalars are identified with ``GH_INTEGER`` metadata.

Operator
++++++++

Represents a matrix constructed on a per-cell basis using Local
Matrix Assembly (LMA) and is identified with ``GH_OPERATOR``
metadata.

Column-Wise Operator
++++++++++++++++++++

The Dynamo0.3 API has support for the construction and use of
column-wise/Column Matrix Assembly (CMA) operators whose metadata
identifier is ``GH_COLUMNWISE_OPERATOR``. As the name suggests,
these are operators constructed for a whole column of the mesh.
These are themselves constructed from the Local Matrix Assembly
(LMA) operators of each cell in the column. The rules governing
Kernels that have CMA operators as arguments are given in the
:ref:`dynamo0.3-kernel` section below.

There are three recognised Kernel types involving CMA operations;
construction, application (including inverse application) and
matrix-matrix. The following example sketches-out what the use
of such kernels might look like in the Algorithm layer:
::

  use field_mod, only: field_type
  use operator_mod, only : operator_type, columnwise_operator_type
  type(field_type) :: field1, field2, field3
  type(operator_type) :: lma_op1, lma_op2
  type(columnwise_operator_type) :: cma_op1, cma_op2, cma_op3
  real(kind=r_def) :: alpha
  ...
  call invoke(                                                    &
          assembly_kernel(cma_op1, lma_op1, lma_op2),             &
          assembly_kernel2(cma_op2, lma_op1, lma_op2, field3),    &
          apply_kernel(field1, field2, cma_op1),                  &
          matrix_matrix_kernel(cma_op3, cma_op1, alpha, cma_op2), &
          apply_kernel(field3, field1, cma_op3),                  &
          name="cma_example")

The above invoke uses two LMA operators to construct the CMA operator
``cma_op1``.  A second CMA operator, ``cma_op2``, is assembled from
the same two LMA operators but also uses a field. The first of these
CMA operators is then applied to ``field2`` and the result stored in
``field1`` (assuming that the metadata for ``apply_kernel`` specifies
that it is the first field argument that is written to). The two CMA
operators are then combined to produce a third, ``cma_op3``. This is
then applied to ``field1`` and the result stored in ``field3``.

Note that PSyclone identifies the type of kernels performing
Column-Wise operations based on their arguments as described in
metadata (see :ref:`dynamo0.3-cma-mdata-rules` below). The names of the
kernels in the above example are purely illustrative and are not used
by PSyclone when determining kernel type.

A full example of CMA operator construction is available in
``examples/lfric/eg7``.

.. _dynamo0.3-quadrature:

Quadrature
++++++++++

Kernels conforming to the Dynamo0.3 API may require quadrature
information (specified using e.g. ``gh_shape = gh_quadrature_XYoZ`` in
the kernel metadata - see Section :ref:`dynamo0.3-gh-shape`). This information
must be passed to the kernel from the Algorithm layer in the form of a
`quadrature_type` object. This must be the last argument passed to the
kernel, e.g.:

::

      type( quadrature_type )   :: qr
      ...
      qr = quadrature_type(element_order+2, GAUSSIAN)
      call invoke(pressure_gradient_kernel_type(rhs_tmp(igh_u), rho, theta, qr),   &
                  kinetic_energy_gradient_kernel_type(rhs_tmp(igh_u), u, chi, qr), &
                  geopotential_gradient_kernel_type(rhs_tmp(igh_u), geopotential, qr))

This quadrature object specifies the set of points at which the
basis/differential-basis functions required by the kernel are to be evaluated.

.. _dynamo0.3-alg-stencil:

Stencils
++++++++

Kernel metadata may specify that a Kernel performs a stencil operation
on a field. Any such metadata must provide a stencil type. See the
:ref:`dynamo0.3-api-meta-args` section for more details. The supported
stencil types are ``X1D``, ``Y1D``, ``XORY1D`` or ``CROSS``.

If a stencil operation is specified by the Kernel metadata the
algorithm layer must provide the ``extent`` of the stencil (the
maximum distance from the central cell that the stencil extends). The
Dynamo0.3 API expects this information to be added as an additional
``integer`` argument immediately after the relevant field when specifying
the Kernel via an ``invoke``.

For example::

  integer :: extent = 2
  call invoke(kernel(field1, field2, extent))

where ``field2`` has kernel metadata specifying that it has a stencil
access.

``extent``  may also be passed as a literal. For example::

  call invoke(kernel(field1, field2, 2))

where, again, ``field2`` has kernel metadata specifying that it has a
stencil access.

.. note:: The stencil extent specified in the Algorithm layer is not the
          same as the stencil size passed in to the Kernel. The latter
          contains the number of cells in the stencil which is dependent
          on both the stencil type and extent.

If the Kernel metadata specifies that the stencil is of type
``XORY1D`` (which means ``X1D`` or ``Y1D``) then the algorithm layer
must specify whether the stencil is ``X1D`` or ``Y1D`` for that
particular kernel call. The Dynamo0.3 API expects this information to
be added as an additional argument immediately after the relevant
stencil extent argument. The argument should be an ``integer`` with
valid values being ``x_direction`` or ``y_direction``, both being
supplied by the ``LFRic`` infrastructure via the
``flux_direction_mod`` fortran module

For example::

  use flux_direction_mod, only : x_direction
  integer :: direction = x_direction
  integer :: extent = 2
  ! ...
  call invoke(kernel(field1, field2, extent, direction))

``direction`` may also be passed as a literal. For example::

  use flux_direction_mod, only : x_direction
  integer :: extent = 2
  ! ...
  call invoke(kernel(field1, field2, extent, x_direction))

If certain fields use the same value of extent and/or direction then
the same variable, or literal value can be provided.

For example::

  call invoke(kernel1(field1, field2, extent,  field3, extent, direction), &
              kernel2(field1, field2, extent2, field4, extent, direction))

In the above example ``field2`` and ``field3`` in ``kernel1`` and
``field4`` in ``kernel2`` will have the same ``extent`` value but
``field2`` in ``kernel2`` may have a different value. Similarly,
``field3`` in ``kernel1`` and ``field4`` in ``kernel2`` will have the
same ``direction`` value.

An example of the use of stencils is available in ``examples/lfric/eg5``.

There is currently no attempt to perform type checking in PSyclone so
any errors in the type and/or position of arguments will not be picked
up until compile time. However, PSyclone does check for the correct
number of algorithm arguments. If the wrong number of arguments is
provided then an exception is raised.

For example, running test 19.2 from the Dynamo0.3 API test suite gives::

  cd <PSYCLONEHOME>/src/psyclone/tests
  psyclone test_files/dynamo0p3/19.2_single_stencil_broken.f90
  "Generation Error: error: expected '5' arguments in the algorithm layer but found '4'.
  Expected '4' standard arguments, '1' stencil arguments and '0' qr_arguments'"

Inter-grid
++++++++++

From the Algorithm layer, an Invoke for inter-grid kernels (those that
map fields between grids of different resolution) looks much like an
Invoke containing general-purpose kernels. The only restrictions to be
aware of are that inter-grid kernels accept only field or field-vectors
as arguments and that an Invoke may not mix inter-grid kernels with
any other kernel type. (Hence the second, separate Invoke in the
example Algorithm code given at the beginning of this Section.)

PSy-layer
---------

The general details of the PSy-layer are explained in the
:ref:`PSy-layer` section. This section describes any dynamo0p3 specific
issues.

Module name
+++++++++++

The PSy-layer code is contained within a Fortran module. The name of
the module is determined from the algorithm-layer name with "_psy"
appended. The algorithm-layer name is the algorithm's module name if it
is a module, its subroutine name if it is a subroutine that is not
within a module, or the program name if it is a program.

So, for example, if the algorithm code is contained within a module
called "fred" then the PSy-layer module name will be "fred_psy".

.. _dynamo0.3-kernel:

Kernel
-------

The general requirements for the structure of a Kernel are explained
in the :ref:`kernel-layer` section. In the Dynamo0.3 API there are four
different Kernel types; general purpose, CMA, inter-grid and
:ref:`dynamo0.3-built-ins`. In the case of built-ins, PSyclone generates
the source of the kernels.  This section explains the rules for the
other three, user-supplied kernel types and then goes on to describe
their metadata and subroutine arguments.

.. _dynamo0.3-user-kernel-rules:

Rules for all User-Supplied Kernels
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In the following, 'operator' refers to both LMA and CMA operator
types.

1) A Kernel must have at least one argument that is a field, field
   vector, or operator. This rule reflects the fact that a Kernel
   iterates over a space and therefore must have some representation
   over that space.

2) The continuity of the iteration space of the Kernel is determined
   from the function space of the modified argument (see Section
   :ref:`Supported Function Spaces <dynamo0.3-function-space>` below).
   If more than one argument is modified then the iteration space is taken
   to be the largest required by any of those arguments. E.g. if a Kernel
   writes to two fields, the first on ``W3`` (discontinuous) and the
   second on ``W1`` (continuous), then the iteration space of that Kernel
   will be determined by the field on the continuous space.

3) If any of the modified arguments are declared with the generic
   function space metadata (e.g. ``ANY_SPACE_n``, see
   :ref:`Supported Function Spaces <dynamo0.3-function-space>`)
   and their actual space cannot be determined statically then the
   iteration space is assumed to be

   1) discontinuous for ``ANY_DISCONTINUOUS_SPACE_n``;

   2) continuous for ``ANY_SPACE_n`` and ``ANY_W2``.  This assumption
      is always safe but leads to additional computation if the quantities
      being updated are actually on discontinuous function spaces.

4) Operators do not have halo operations operating on them as they
   are either cell- (LMA) or column-based (CMA) and therefore act
   like discontinuous fields.

5) Any Kernel that writes to an operator will have its iteration
   space expanded such that valid values for the operator are
   computed in the level-1 halo.

6) Any Kernel that reads from an operator must not access halos
   beyond level 1. In this case PSyclone will check that the Kernel
   does not require values beyond the level-1 halo. If it does then
   PSyclone will abort.

Rules specific to General-Purpose Kernels without CMA Operators
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1) General-purpose kernels accept arguments of any of the following
   types: field, field vector, LMA operator, scalar integer, scalar
   real.

2) A Kernel is permitted to write to more than one
   quantity (field or operator) and these quantities may be on the
   same or different function spaces.

3) A Kernel may not write to a scalar argument. (Only
   :ref:`built-ins <dynamo0.3-built-ins>` are permitted to do this.) Any
   scalar aguments must therefore be declared in the metadata as
   ``GH_READ`` - see :ref:`below <dynamo0.3-valid-access>`.

.. _dynamo0.3-cma-mdata-rules:

Rules for Kernels that work with CMA Operators
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Dynamo0.3 API has support for kernels that assemble, apply (or
inverse-apply) column-wise/Column Matrix Assembly (CMA) operators.
Such operators may also be used by matrix-matrix kernels. There are
thus three types of CMA-related kernels.  Since, by definition, CMA
operators only act on data within a column, they have no horizontal
dependencies. Therefore, kernels that write to them may be
parallelised without colouring.

All three CMA-related kernel types must obey the following rules:

1) Since a CMA operator only acts within a single column of data,
   stencil operations are not permitted.

2) No vector quantities (e.g. "GH_FIELD*3" - see below) are
   permitted as arguments.

There are then additional rules specific to each of the three
CMA kernel types. These are described below.

Assembly
########

CMA operators are themselves constructed from Local-Matrix-Assembly
(LMA) operators. Therefore, any kernel which assembles a CMA
operator must obey the following rules:

1) Have one or more LMA operators as read-only arguments.

2) Have exactly one CMA operator argument which must have write access.

3) Other types of argument (e.g. scalars or fields) are permitted but
   must be read-only.

Application and Inverse Application
###################################

Column-wise operators can only be applied to fields. CMA-Application
kernels must therefore:

1) Have a single CMA operator as a read-only argument.

2) Have exactly two field arguments, one read-only and one that is written to.

3) The function spaces of the read and written fields must match the
   from and to spaces, respectively, of the supplied CMA operator.

Matrix-Matrix
#############

A kernel that has just column-wise operators as arguments and zero or
more read-only scalars is identified as performing a matrix-matrix
operation. In this case:

1) Arguments must be CMA operators and, optionally, one or more scalars.

2) Exactly one of the CMA arguments must be written to while all other
   arguments must be read-only.

Rules for Inter-Grid Kernels
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1) An inter-grid kernel is identified by the presence of a field or
   field-vector argument with the optional `mesh_arg` metadata element (see
   :ref:`dynamo0.3-intergrid-mdata`).

2) An invoke that contains one or more inter-grid kernels must not contain
   any other kernel types. (This restriction is an implementation decision
   and could be lifted in future if there is a need.)

3) An inter-grid kernel is only permitted to have field or field-vector
   arguments.

4) All inter-grid kernel arguments must have the `mesh_arg` metadata entry.

5) An inter-grid kernel (and metadata) must have at least one field on
   each of the fine and coarse meshes. Specifying all fields as coarse or
   fine is forbidden.

6) Fields on different meshes must always live on different function spaces.

7) All fields on a given mesh must be on the same function space.

A consequence of Rules 5-7 is that an inter-grid kernel will
only involve two function spaces.


Metadata
++++++++

The code below outlines the elements of the Dynamo0.3 API kernel
metadata, 1) 'meta_args', 2) 'meta_funcs', 3) 'meta_reference_element',
4) 'gh_shape', 5) 'iterates_over' and 6) 'procedure'.

::

  type, public, extends(kernel_type) :: my_kernel_type
    type(arg_type) :: meta_args(...) = (/ ... /)
    type(func_type) :: meta_funcs(...) = (/ ... /)
    type(reference_element_data_type) :: meta_reference_element(...) = (/ ... /)
    integer :: gh_shape = gh_quadrature_XYoZ
    integer :: iterates_over = cells
  contains
    procedure, nopass :: my_kernel_code
  end type

These six metadata elements are discussed in order in the following
sections.

.. _dynamo0.3-api-meta-args:

meta_args
#########

The ``meta_args`` array specifies information about data that the
kernel code expects to be passed to it via its argument list. There is
one entry in the ``meta_args`` array for each **scalar**, **field**,
or **operator** passed into the Kernel and the order that these occur
in the ``meta_args`` array must be the same as they are expected in
the kernel code argument list. The entry must be of ``arg_type`` which
itself contains metadata about the associated argument. The size of
the meta_args array must correspond to the number of **scalars**,
**fields** and **operators** passed into the Kernel.

.. note:: It makes no sense for a Kernel to have only **scalar** arguments
          (because the PSy layer will call a Kernel for each point in the
          spatial domain) and PSyclone will reject such Kernels.

For example, if there are a total of 2 **scalar** / **field** /
**operator** entities being passed to the Kernel then the meta_args
array will be of size 2 and there will be two ``arg_type`` entries:

::

  type(arg_type) :: meta_args(2) = (/                                  &
       arg_type( ... ),                                                &
       arg_type( ... )                                                 &
       /)

Argument-metadata (metadata contained within the brackets of an
``arg_type`` entry), describes either a **scalar**, a **field** or an
**operator** (either LMA or CMA).

The first argument-metadata entry describes whether the data that is
being passed is for a real scalar (``GH_REAL``), an integer scalar
(``GH_INTEGER``), a field (``GH_FIELD``) or an operator (either
``GH_OPERATOR`` for LMA or ``GH_COLUMNWISE_OPERATOR`` for CMA). This
information is mandatory.

Additionally, argument-metadata can be used to describe a vector of
fields (see the :ref:`dynamo0.3-field-vector` section for more
details).

As an example, the following ``meta_args`` metadata describes 4
entries, the first is a real scalar, the next two are fields and the
fourth is an operator. The third entry is a field vector of size 3.

::

  type(arg_type) :: meta_args(4) = (/                                  &
       arg_type(GH_REAL, ...),                                         &
       arg_type(GH_FIELD, ... ),                                       &
       arg_type(GH_FIELD*3, ... ),                                     &
       arg_type(GH_OPERATOR, ...)                                      &
       /)

The second entry to argument-metadata (information contained within
the brackets of an ``arg_type``) describes how the Kernel makes use of
the data being passed into it (the way it is accessed within a
Kernel). This information is mandatory. There are currently 5 possible
values of this metadata ``GH_WRITE``, ``GH_READ``, ``GH_INC``,
``GH_READWRITE`` and ``GH_SUM``. However, not all combinations of
metadata entries are valid and PSyclone will raise an exception if an
invalid combination is specified. Valid combinations are specified
later in this section (see :ref:`dynamo0.3-valid-access`).

* ``GH_WRITE`` indicates the data is modified in the Kernel before
  (optionally) being read.

* ``GH_READ`` indicates that the data is read and is unmodified.

* ``GH_INC`` indicates that different iterations of a Kernel make
  contributions to shared values. For example, values at cell faces
  may receive contributions from cells on either side of the
  face. This means that such a Kernel needs appropriate
  synchronisation (or colouring) to run in parallel.

* ``GH_READWRITE`` indicates that different iterations of a Kernel
  update quantities which do not share DoFs, such as operators and
  fields over discontinuous function spaces. If a Kernel modifies only
  discontinuous fields and/or operators there is no need for
  synchronisation or colouring when running such Kernels in parallel.
  However, modifying another field with a ``GH_INC`` access in a
  Kernel means that synchronisation or colouring is required for
  parallel runs.

* ``GH_SUM`` is an example of a reduction and is the only reduction
  currently supported in PSyclone. This metadata indicates that values
  are summed over calls to Kernel code.

For example:

::

  type(arg_type) :: meta_args(4) = (/                                  &
       arg_type(GH_REAL,  GH_SUM),                                     &
       arg_type(GH_FIELD, GH_INC, ... ),                               &
       arg_type(GH_FIELD*3, GH_WRITE, ... ),                           &
       arg_type(GH_OPERATOR, GH_READ, ...)                             &
       /)

.. note:: In the Dynamo0.3 API only :ref:`dynamo0.3-built-ins` are permitted
          to write to scalar arguments (and hence perform reductions).
          Furthermore, this permission is currently restricted to real
          scalars (``GH_REAL``) as the LFRic infrastructure does not
          yet support integer reductions.

For a scalar the argument metadata contains only these two entries.
However, fields and operators require further entries specifying
function-space information.
The meaning of these further entries differs depending on whether a
field or an operator is being described.

In the case of an operator, the 3rd and 4th arguments describe the
``to`` and ``from`` function spaces respectively. In the case of a
field the 3rd argument specifies the function space that the field
lives on. More details about the supported function spaces are in
subsection :ref:`dynamo0.3-function-space`.

For example, the metadata for a kernel that applies a Column-wise
operator to a field might look like:

::

  type(arg_type) :: meta_args(3) = (/                     &
       arg_type(GH_FIELD, GH_INC, W1),                    &
       arg_type(GH_FIELD, GH_READ, W2H),                  &
       arg_type(GH_COLUMNWISE_OPERATOR, GH_READ, W1, W2H) &
       /)

In some cases a Kernel may be written so that it works for fields and/or
operators from any type of a vector ``W2*`` space (all ``W2*`` spaces
except for the ``W2trace`` space, see Section
:ref:`Supported Function Spaces <dynamo0.3-function-space>` below).
In this case the metadata should be specified as being ``ANY_W2``.

.. Warning:: In the current implementation it is assumed that all
             fields and/or operators specifying ``ANY_W2`` within a
             kernel will use the **same** function space. It is up to
             the user to ensure this is the case as otherwise invalid
             code would be generated.

It may be that a Kernel is written such that a field and/or operators
may be on/map-between any function space(s). In this case the metadata
should be specified as being one of ``ANY_SPACE_1``, ..., ``ANY_SPACE_10``
(see :ref:`Supported Function Spaces <dynamo0.3-function-space>`). If
the generic function spaces are known to be discontinuous the metadata
may be specified as being one of ``ANY_DISCONTINUOUS_SPACE_1``, ...,
``ANY_DISCONTINUOUS_SPACE_10`` in order to avoid unnecessary computation
into the halos (see rules for
:ref:`user-supplied kernels <dynamo0.3-user-kernel-rules>` above).
The reason for having different names is that a Kernel might be written
to allow 2 or more arguments to be able to support any function space
but for a particular call the function spaces may have to be the same
as each other.

In the example below, the first field entry supports any function space but
it must be the same as the operator's ``to`` function space. Similarly,
the second field entry supports any function space but it must be the same
as the operator's ``from`` function space. Note, the metadata does not
forbid ``ANY_SPACE_1`` and ``ANY_SPACE_2`` from being the same.

::

  type(arg_type) :: meta_args(3) = (/                           &
       arg_type(GH_FIELD, GH_INC, ANY_SPACE_1),                 &
       arg_type(GH_FIELD*3, GH_WRITE, ANY_SPACE_2),             &
       arg_type(GH_OPERATOR, GH_READ, ANY_SPACE_1, ANY_SPACE_2) &
       /)

Note also that the scope of this naming of any-space function spaces is
restricted to the argument list of individual kernels. I.e. if an
Invoke contains say, two kernel calls that each support arguments on
any function space, e.g. ``ANY_SPACE_1``, there is no requirement that
these two function spaces be the same. Put another way, if an Invoke
contained two calls of a kernel with arguments described by the above
metadata then the first field argument passed to each kernel call
need not be on the same space.

.. _dynamo0.3-valid-access:

Valid Access Modes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned earlier, not all combinations of metadata are
valid. Valid combinations are summarised here. All types of data
(``GH_INTEGER``, ``GH_REAL``, ``GH_FIELD``, ``GH_OPERATOR`` and
``GH_COLUMNWISE_OPERATOR``) may be read within a Kernel and this is
specified in metadata using ``GH_READ``. At least one kernel argument
must be listed as being modified. When data is *modified* in a Kernel
then the permitted access modes depend on the type of data it is and
the function space it is on. Valid values are given in the table
below.

======================  ============================  =========================
Argument Type           Function Space                Access Type
======================  ============================  =========================
*GH_INTEGER*            *n/a*                         *GH_SUM (Built-ins only)*
GH_REAL                 n/a                           GH_SUM (Built-ins only)
GH_FIELD                Discontinuous                 GH_WRITE, GH_READWRITE
GH_FIELD                Continuous                    GH_INC
GH_OPERATOR             Any for both 'to' and 'from'  GH_WRITE, GH_READWRITE
GH_COLUMNWISE_OPERATOR  Any for both 'to' and 'from'  GH_WRITE, GH_READWRITE
======================  ============================  =========================

.. note:: As mentioned above, note that only Built-ins may modify
          scalar arguments. *Since the LFRic infrastructure does not
          currently support integer reductions, integer scalar arguments
          are restricted to having read-only access.*

.. note:: A ``GH_FIELD`` argument that specifies ``GH_WRITE`` or
          ``GH_READWRITE`` as its access pattern must be a discontinuous
          function in the horizontal (see :ref:`dynamo0.3-function-space`
          for list of discontinuous function spaces) and it will not
          need colouring. If the field is described as being on any space,
          there is currently no way to determine this from the metadata
          (unless we can statically determine the space of the field
          being passed in). At the moment this type of Kernel is always
          treated as if it is continuous in the horizontal, even if it is
          not (see rules for :ref:`user-supplied kernels
          <dynamo0.3-user-kernel-rules>` above).

There is no restriction on the number and function spaces of other
quantities that a general-purpose kernel can modify other than that it
must modify at least one. The rules for kernels involving CMA operators,
however, are stricter and only one argument may be modified (the CMA
operator itself for assembly, a field for CMA-application and a CMA
operator for matrix-matrix kernels). If a kernel writes to quantities
on different function spaces then PSyclone generates loop bounds
appropriate to the largest iteration space. This means that if a
single kernel updates one quantity on a continuous function space and
one on a discontinuous space then the resulting loop will include
cells in the level-1 halo since they are required for a quantity on a
continuous space. As a consequence, any quantities on a discontinuous
space will then be computed redundantly in the level-1 halo. Currently
PSyclone makes no attempt to take advantage of this (by e.g. setting
the appropriate level-1 halo to 'clean').

PSyclone ensures that both CMA and LMA operators are computed
(redundantly) out to the level-1 halo cells. This permits their use in
kernels which modify quantities on continuous function spaces and also
in subsequent redundant computation of other quantities on
discontinuous function spaces. In conjunction with this, PSyclone also
checks (when generating the PSy layer) that any kernels which read
operator values do not do so beyond the level-1 halo. If any such
accesses are found then PSyclone aborts.

.. _dynamo0.3-function-space:

Supported Function Spaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned in the :ref:`dynamo0.3-field` and :ref:`dynamo0.3-field-vector`
sections, the function space of an argument specifies how it maps
onto the underlying topology and, additionally, whether the data at a
point is a vector. In Dynamo0.3 API the dimension of the basis function
set for the scalar function spaces is 1 and for the vector function spaces
is 3 (see the table in :ref:`dynamo0.3-stub-generation-rules` for the
dimensions of the basis and differential basis functions).

Function spaces can share DoFs between cells in the horizontal, vertical
or both directions. Depending on the function space and FEM order,
the shared DoFs can lie on one or more cell entities (faces, edges
and vertices) in each direction. This property is referred to as the
**continuity** of a function space (horizontal, vertical or full).
Alternatively, if there are no shared DoFs a function space is described
as **discontinuous** (fully or in a particular direction).

The mixed FEM formulation is built on a foundation set of four function
spaces described below.

* ``W0`` is the space of scalar functions with full continuity. The
  shared DoFs lie on cell vertices in the lowest order FEM and on
  all three entities in higher order FEM.

* ``W1`` is the space of vector functions with full continuity in the
  tangential direction only. In the lowest order FEM the shared DoFs
  lie on cell edges for each component, whereas in higher order they
  also lie on cell faces.

* ``W2`` is the space of vector functions with full continuity in the
  normal direction only. The shared DoFs lie on cell faces for each
  component.

* ``W3`` is the space of scalar functions with full discontinuity.
  All DoFs lie within the cell volume and are not shared across the
  cell boundaries.

Other spaces required for representation of scalar or component-wise
vector variables are:

* ``Wtheta`` is the space of scalar functions based on the vertical
  part of ``W2``, discontinuous in the horizontal and continuous
  in the vertical;

* ``W2H`` is the space of vector functions based on the horizontal
  part of ``W2``, continuous in the horizontal and discontinuous
  in the vertical;

* ``W2V`` is the space of vector functions based on the vertical
  part of ``W2``, discontinuous in the horizontal and continuous
  in the vertical;

* ``W2broken`` is the space of vector functions, locally identical
  to the ``W2`` space. However, DoFs are topologically discontinuous in
  all directions despite their placement on cell faces;

* ``W2trace`` is the space of scalar functions defined only on cell faces,
  resulting from taking the trace of a ``W2`` space. DoFs are shared between
  faces, hence making this space fully continuous.

In addition to the specific function space metadata, there are also
three generic function space metadata descriptors mentioned in
sections above:

* ``ANY_SPACE_n``, *n = 1, 2, ... 10*, for when the function space
  of the modified argument(s) cannot be determined and/or for when a
  Kernel has been written so that it works with fields on any of the
  available spaces;

* ``ANY_DISCONTINUOUS_SPACE_n``, *n = 1, 2, ... 10*, for when the
  function space of the modified argument(s) cannot be determined but
  is known to be discontinuous and/or for when a Kernel has been written
  so that it works with fields on any of the discontinuous spaces;

* ``ANY_W2`` for any type of a vector ``W2*`` function space, i.e.\ ``W2``,
  ``W2H``, ``W2V`` and ``W2broken`` but not ``W2trace``.

As mentioned :ref:`previously <dynamo0.3-user-kernel-rules>` ,
``ANY_SPACE_n`` and ``ANY_W2`` function space types are treated as
continuous while ``ANY_DISCONTINUOUS_SPACE_n`` spaces are treated
as discontinuous.

Since the Dynamo0.3 API operates on columns of data, function spaces
are categorised as continuous or discontinuous with regard to their
**continuity in the horizontal**. For example, a ``GH_FIELD`` that
specifies ``GH_INC`` as its access pattern (see
:ref:dynamo0.3-valid-access: above) may be continuous in the vertical
(and discontinuous in the horizontal), continuous in the horizontal
(and discontinuous in the vertical), or continuous in both. In each
case the code is the same. This principle of horizontal continuity also
applies to the three generic ``ANY_*_*`` function space identifiers
above. The valid metadata values for continuous and discontinuous
function apaces are summarised in the table below.

.. tabularcolumns:: |l|l|

+---------------------------+----------------------------+
| Function Space Continuity | Function Space Name        |
+===========================+============================+
| Continuous                | W0, W1, W2, W2H, W2trace,  |
|                           | ANY_W2, ANY_SPACE_n        |
+---------------------------+----------------------------+
| Discontinuous             | W2V, W2broken, W3, Wtheta, |
|                           | ANY_DISCONTINUOUS_SPACE_n  |
+---------------------------+----------------------------+

Horizontally discontinuous function spaces and fields over them will not
need colouring so PSyclone does not perform it. If such attempt is made,
PSyclone will raise a ``Generation Error`` in the **Dynamo0p3ColourTrans**
transformation (see :ref:`dynamo0.3-api-transformations` for more details
on transformations). An example of fields iterating over a discontinuous
function space ``Wtheta`` is given in ``examples/lfric/eg9``, with the
``GH_READWRITE`` access descriptor denoting an update to the relevant
fields. This example also demonstrates how to only colour loops over
continuous function spaces when transformations are applied.

Optional Field Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A field entry in the meta_args array may have an optional fourth element.
This element describes either a stencil access or, for inter-grid kernels,
which mesh the field is on. Since an inter-grid kernel is not permitted
to have stencil accesses, these two options are mutually exclusive.
The metadata for each case is described in the following sections.

Stencil Metadata
________________


Stencil metadata specifies that the corresponding field argument is accessed
as a stencil operation within the Kernel.  Stencil metadata only makes sense
if the associated field is read within a Kernel i.e. it only makes
sense to specify stencil metadata if the first entry is ``GH_FIELD``
and the second entry is ``GH_READ``.

Stencil metadata is written in the following format:

::

  STENCIL(type)

where ``type`` may be one of ``X1D``, ``Y1D``, ``XORY1D`` or
``CROSS``.  As the stencil ``extent`` (the maximum distance from the
central cell that the stencil extends) is not provided in the metadata,
it is expected to be provided by the algorithm writer as part of the
``invoke`` call (see Section :ref:`dynamo0.3-alg-stencil`). As there
is currently no way to specify a fixed extent value for stencils in the
Kernel metadata, Kernels must therefore be written to support
different values of extent (i.e. stencils with a variable number of
cells).

The ``XORY1D`` stencil type indicates that the Kernel can accept
either ``X1D`` or ``Y1D`` stencils. In this case it is up to the
algorithm developer to specify which of these it is from the algorithm
layer as part of the ``invoke`` call (see Section
:ref:`dynamo0.3-alg-stencil`).

For example, the following stencil (with ``extent=2``):

::

  | 4 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 5 |

would be declared as

::

  STENCIL(X1D)

and the following stencil (with ``extent=2``)

::

  |   |   | 9 |   |   |
  |   |   | 5 |   |   |
  | 6 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 7 |
  |   |   | 4 |   |   |
  |   |   | 8 |   |   |

would be declared as

::

  STENCIL(CROSS)

Below is an example of stencil information within the full kernel metadata.

::

  type(arg_type) :: meta_args(3) = (/                                  &
       arg_type(GH_FIELD, GH_INC, W1),                                 &
       arg_type(GH_FIELD, GH_READ, W2H, STENCIL(CROSS)),               &
       arg_type(GH_OPERATOR, GH_READ, W1, W2H)                         &
       /)

There is a full example of this distributed with PSyclone. It may
be found in ``examples/lfric/eg5``.

.. _dynamo0.3-intergrid-mdata:

Inter-Grid Metadata
___________________


The alternative form of the optional fourth metadata argument for a
field specifies which mesh the associated field is on.  This is
required for inter-grid kernels which perform prolongation or
restriction operations on fields (or field vectors) existing on grids
of different resolutions.

Mesh metadata is written in the following format:

::

  mesh_arg=type

where ``type`` may be one of ``GH_COARSE`` or ``GH_FINE``. Any kernel
having a field argument with this metadata is assumed to be an
inter-grid kernel and, as such, all of its other arguments (which
must also be fields) must have it specified too. An example of the
metadata for such a kernel is given below:

::

  type(arg_type) :: meta_args(2) = (/                                                  &
      arg_type(GH_FIELD, GH_READWRITE, ANY_DISCONTINUOUS_SPACE_1, mesh_arg=GH_COARSE), &
      arg_type(GH_FIELD, GH_READ,      ANY_DISCONTINUOUS_SPACE_2, mesh_arg=GH_FINE  )  &
      /)

Note that an inter-grid kernel must have at least one field (or field-
vector) argument on each mesh type. Fields that are on different
meshes cannot be on the same function space while those on the same
mesh must also be on the same function space.


Column-wise Operators (CMA)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section we provide example metadata for each of the three
recognised kernel types involving CMA operators.

Column-wise operators are constructed from cell-wise (local) operators.
Therefore, in order to **assemble** a CMA operator, a kernel must have at
least one read-only LMA operator, e.g.:
::

   type(arg_type) :: meta_args(2) = (/                                       &
        arg_type(GH_OPERATOR,            GH_READ,  ANY_SPACE_1, ANY_SPACE_2),&
        arg_type(GH_COLUMNWISE_OPERATOR, GH_WRITE, ANY_SPACE_1, ANY_SPACE_2) &
        /)

CMA operators (and their inverse) are **applied** to fields. Therefore any
kernel of this type must have one read-only CMA operator, one read-only
field and a field that is updated, e.g.:
::

   type(arg_type) :: meta_args(3) = (/                                      &
        arg_type(GH_FIELD,    GH_INC,  ANY_SPACE_1),                        &
        arg_type(GH_FIELD,    GH_READ, ANY_SPACE_2),                        &
        arg_type(GH_COLUMNWISE_OPERATOR, GH_READ, ANY_SPACE_1, ANY_SPACE_2) &
        /)

**Matrix-matrix** kernels compute the product/linear combination of CMA
operators. They must therefore have one such operator that is updated while
the rest are read-only. They may also have read-only scalar arguments, e.g.:
::

   type(arg_type) :: meta_args(3) = (/                                        &
        arg_type(GH_COLUMNWISE_OPERATOR, GH_WRITE, ANY_SPACE_1, ANY_SPACE_2), &
        arg_type(GH_COLUMNWISE_OPERATOR, GH_READ, ANY_SPACE_1, ANY_SPACE_2),  &
        arg_type(GH_COLUMNWISE_OPERATOR, GH_READ, ANY_SPACE_1, ANY_SPACE_2),  &
        arg_type(GH_REAL, GH_READ) /)

.. note:: The order with which arguments are specified in metadata for CMA
          kernels does not affect the process of identifying the type of
          kernel (whether it is assembly, matrix-matrix etc.)

.. _dynamo0.3-meta-funcs:

meta_funcs
##########

The (optional) second component of kernel metadata specifies
whether any quadrature or evaluator data is required for a given
function space. (If no quadrature or evaluator data is required then
this metadata should be omitted.) Consider the
following kernel metadata:

::

    type, extends(kernel_type) :: testkern_operator_type
      type(arg_type), dimension(3) :: meta_args =     &
          (/ arg_type(gh_operator, gh_write, w0, w0), &
             arg_type(gh_field*3,  gh_read,  w1),     &
             arg_type(gh_integer,  gh_read)           &
          /)
      type(func_type) :: meta_funcs(2) =              &
          (/ func_type(w0, gh_basis, gh_diff_basis)   &
             func_type(w1, gh_basis)                  &
          /)
      integer :: gh_shape = gh_quadrature_XYoZ
      integer :: iterates_over = cells
    contains
      procedure, nopass :: code => testkern_operator_code
    end type testkern_operator_type

The ``arg_type`` component of this metadata describes a kernel that
takes three arguments (an operator, a field and an integer
scalar). Following the ``meta_args`` array we now have a
``meta_funcs`` array. This allows the user to specify that the kernel
requires basis functions (``gh_basis``) and/or the differential of the
basis functions (``gh_diff_basis``) on one or more of the function
spaces associated with the arguments listed in ``meta_args``.  In this
case we require both for the W0 function space but only basis
functions for W1.

meta_reference_element
######################

A kernel that requires properties of the reference element in LFRic
specifies those properties through the ``meta_reference_element``
metadata entry.  (If no reference element properties are required then
this metadata should be omitted.)  Consider the following example
kernel metadata::

  type, extends(kernel_type) :: testkern_type
    type(arg_type), dimension(2) :: meta_args = &
        (/ arg_type(gh_field, gh_read, w1),     &
           arg_type(gh_field, gh_write, w0) /)
    type(reference_element_data_type), dimension(2) ::               &
      meta_reference_element =                                       &
        (/ reference_element_data_type(normals_to_horizontal_faces), &
           reference_element_data_type(normals_to_vertical_faces) /)
  contains
    procedure, nopass :: code => testkern_code
  end type testkern_type

This metadata specifies that the ``testkern_type`` kernel requires two
properties of the reference element. The supported properties are
listed below:

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{5.5cm}|p{8.5cm}|

===================================  ===========================================
Name                                 Description

                                     (x, y, z) axis direction for each
                                     horizontal face indexed as (component,
                                     face).
normals_to_vertical_faces            Array of normals pointing in the positive
                                     (x, y, z) axis direction for each vertical
                                     face indexed as (component, face).
outward_normals_to_horizontal_faces  Array of outward-pointing normals for each
                                     horizontal face indexed as (component,
                                     face).
outward_normals_to_vertical_faces    Array of outward-pointing normals for each
                                     vertical face indexed as (component, face).
===================================  ===========================================

.. _dynamo0.3-gh-shape:

gh_shape and gh_evaluator_targets
#################################

If a kernel requires basis or differential-basis functions then the
metadata must also specify the set of points on which these functions
are required. This information is provided by the ``gh_shape``
component of the metadata.  Currently PSyclone supports two shapes;
``gh_quadrature_XYoZ`` for Gaussian quadrature points and
``gh_evaluator`` for evaluation (of the basis/differential-basis
functions) at nodal points. For the latter, there are two options: if
an evaluator is required for multiple function spaces then these can
be specified using the additional ``gh_evaluator_targets`` metadata
entry. This entry is a one-dimensional, integer array containing the
desired function spaces. For example, to request basis/differential-basis
functions evaluated on both W0 and W1 the metadata would be::

    integer :: gh_shape = gh_evaluator
    integer :: gh_evaluator_targets(2) = (/W0, W1/)

The kernel must have an argument (field or operator) on each of the
function spaces listed in ``gh_evaluator_targets``.
The default behaviour if ``gh_evaluator_targets`` is not specified is
to provide evaluators for each function space associated with the
quantities that the kernel is updating. All necessary data is
extracted in the PSy layer and passed to the kernel(s) as required -
nothing is required from the Algorithm layer. If a kernel requires
quadrature on the other hand, the Algorithm writer must supply a
``quadrature_type`` object as the last argument to the kernel (see
Section :ref:`dynamo0.3-quadrature`).

Note that it is an error for kernel metadata to specify a value for
``gh_shape`` if no basis or differential-basis functions are required.
It is also an error to specify ``gh_evaluator_targets`` if the kernel
does not require an evaluator (i.e. ``gh_shape != gh_evaluator``).

iterates over
#############

The fourth type of metadata provided is ``ITERATES_OVER``. This
specifies that the Kernel has been written with the assumption that it
is iterating over the specified entity. For user-supplied kernels this
currently only has one valid value which is ``CELLS``.

Procedure
#########

The fifth and final type of metadata is ``procedure`` metadata. This
specifies the name of the Kernel subroutine that this metadata
describes.

For example::

  procedure, nopass :: my_kernel_subroutine

Rules for General-Purpose Kernels
#################################

The arguments to general-purpose kernels (those that do not involve
either CMA operators or prolongation/restriction operations) follow a
set of rules which have been specified for the Dynamo0.3 API. These
rules are encoded in the ``generate()`` method within the
``ArgOrdering`` abstract class in the ``dynamo0p3.py`` file. The
rules, along with PSyclone's naming conventions, are:

1) If an LMA operator is passed then include the ``cells`` argument.
   ``cells`` is an integer and has intent ``in``.
2) Include ``nlayers``, the number of layers in a column. ``nlayers``
   is an integer and has intent ``in``.
3) For each scalar/field/vector_field/operator in the order specified by
   the meta_args metadata:

   1) If the current entry is a scalar quantity then include the Fortran
      variable in the argument list. The intent is determined from the
      metadata (see :ref:`dynamo0.3-api-meta-args` for an explanation).
   2) If the current entry is a field then include the field array. The
      field array name is currently specified as being
      ``"field_"<argument_position>"_"<field_function_space>``. A field
      array is a real array of type ``r_def`` and dimensioned as the
      unique degrees of freedom for the space that the field is on.
      This value is passed in separately. Again, the intent is determined
      from the metadata (see :ref:`dynamo0.3-api-meta-args`).

      1) If the field entry has a stencil access then add an integer
         stencil-size argument with intent ``in``. This will supply
         the number of cells in the stencil.
      2) If the field entry stencil access is of type ``XORY1D`` then
         add an integer direction argument with intent ``in``.

   3) If the current entry is a field vector then for each dimension
      of the vector, include a field array. The field array name is
      specified as being using
      ``"field_"<argument_position>"_"<field_function_space>"_v"<vector_position>``.
      A field array in a field vector is declared in the same way as a
      field array (described in the previous step).
   4) If the current entry is an operator then first include a
      dimension size. This is an integer. The name of this size is
      ``<operator_name>"_ncell_3d"``. Next include the operator. This
      is a real array of type ``r_def`` and is 3 dimensional. The
      first two dimensions are the local degrees of freedom for the
      ``to`` and ``from`` function spaces respectively. The third
      dimension is the dimension size mentioned before. The name of
      the operator is ``"op_"<argument_position>``. Again the intent
      is determined from the metadata (see :ref:`dynamo0.3-api-meta-args`).

4) For each function space in the order they appear in the metadata arguments
   (the ``to`` function space of an operator is considered to be before the
   ``from`` function space of the same operator as it appears first in
   lexicographic order)

   1) Include the number of local degrees of freedom (i.e. number per-cell)
      for the function space. This is an integer and has intent ``in``. The
      name of this argument is ``"ndf_"<field_function_space>``.
   2) If there is a field on this space

      1) Include the unique number of degrees of freedom for the function
         space. This is an integer and has intent ``in``. The name of this
         argument is ``"undf_"<field_function_space>``.
      2) Include the **dofmap** for this function space. This is an integer
         array with intent ``in``. It has one dimension sized by the local
         degrees of freedom for the function space.

   3) For each operation on the function space (``basis``, ``diff_basis``,
      ``orientation``) in the order specified in the metadata

      1) If it is a basis or differential basis function then we must pass
         real arrays of kind ``r_def`` with intent ``in``:

         1) If ``gh_shape`` is ``gh_quadrature_xyoz`` then the arrays are of
            rank 4 with extent (``dimension``, ``number_of_dofs``, ``np_xy``,
            ``np_z``). The name of the argument is
            ``"basis_"<field_function_space>`` or
            ``"diff_basis_"<field_function_space>``, as appropriate.

         2) If ``gh_shape`` is ``gh_evaluator`` then we pass one array for
            each target function space (i.e. as specified by
            ``gh_evaluator_targets``). Each of these arrays are of rank 3
            with extent (``dimension``, ``number_of_dofs``,
            ``ndf_<target_function_space>``). The name of the argument is
            ``"basis_"<field_function_space>"_on_"<target_function_space>`` or
            ``"diff_basis_"<field_function_space>"_on_"<target_function_space>``,
            as appropriate.

         where ``dimension`` is 1 or 3 and depends upon the function space
         (see :ref:`dynamo0.3-function-space` above for more information) and
         whether or not it is a basis or a differential basis function (see
         the table below). ``number_of_dofs`` is the number of degrees of
         freedom (DoFs) associated with the function space and ``np_*`` are
         the number of points to be evaluated: i) ``*_xyz`` in
         all directions (3D); ii) ``*_xy`` in the horizontal plane (2D);
         iii) ``*_x, *_y`` in the horizontal (1D); and iv) ``*_z`` in the
         vertical (1D).

         .. tabularcolumns:: |l|c|l|

         +---------------+-----------+------------------------------------+
         | Function Type | Dimension | Function Space Name                |
         +===============+===========+====================================+
         | Basis         |    1      | W0, W2trace, W3, Wtheta            |
         |               +-----------+------------------------------------+
         |               |    3      | W1, W2, W2H, W2V, W2broken, ANY_W2 |

         | Differential  |    1      | W2, W2H, W2V, W2broken, ANY_W2     |
         | Basis         +-----------+------------------------------------+
         |               |    3      | W0, W1, W2trace, W3, Wtheta        |
         +---------------+-----------+------------------------------------+

      2) If it is an orientation array, include the associated argument.
         The argument is an integer array with intent ``in``. There is
         one dimension of size the local degrees of freedom for the
         function space. The name of the array is
         ``"orientation_"<field_function_space>``.

5) If either the ``normals_to_horizontal_faces`` or
   ``outward_normals_to_horizontal_faces`` properties of the reference
   element are required then pass the number of
   horizontal faces of the reference element (``nfaces_re_h``). Similarly,
   if either the ``normals_to_vertical_faces`` or
   ``outward_normals_to_vertical_faces`` are
   required then pass the number of vertical faces (``nfaces_re_v``). Then,
   in the order specified in the ``meta_reference_element`` metadata:

   1) For the ``normals_to_horizontal/vertical_faces``, pass a rank-2 integer
      array with dimensions ``(3, nfaces_re_h/v)``.
   2) For the ``outward_normals_to_horizontal/vertical_faces``, pass a rank-2
      integer array with dimensions ``(3, nfaces_re_h/v)``.

6) If Quadrature is required (``gh_shape = gh_quadrature_*``)

   1) Include integer, scalar arguments with intent ``in`` that specify
      the extent of the basis/diff-basis arrays:

      1) If ``gh_shape`` is ``gh_quadrature_XYoZ`` then pass ``np_xy``
         and ``np_z``.

   2) Include weights which are real arrays of kind ``r_def``:

      1) If ``gh_quadrature_XYoZ`` pass in ``w_XZ(np_xy)`` and ``w_Z(np_z)``.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

.. highlight:: fortran

For instance, if a kernel has only one written argument and requires an
evaluator then its metadata might be::

  type, extends(kernel_type) :: testkern_operator_type
     type(arg_type), dimension(2) :: meta_args =      &
          (/ arg_type(gh_operator, gh_write, w0, w1), &
             arg_type(gh_field*3,  gh_read,  w0) /)
     type(func_type) :: meta_funcs(1) =               &
          (/ func_type(w0, gh_basis) /)
     integer :: iterates_over = cells
     integer :: gh_shape = gh_evaluator
   contains
     procedure, nopass :: code => testkern_operator_code
  end type testkern_operator_type

then we only pass the basis functions evaluated on ``W0`` (the space of
the written kernel argument). The subroutine arguments will therefore
be::

  subroutine testkern_operator_code(cell, nlayers, ncell_3d,        &
       local_stencil, xdata, ydata, zdata, ndf_w0, undf_w0, map_w0, &
       basis_w0_on_w0, ndf_w1)

where ``local_stencil`` is the operator, ``xdata``, ``ydata``
etc\. are the three components of the field vector and ``map_w0`` is
the dofmap for the ``W0`` function space.

If instead, ``gh_evaluator_targets`` is specified in the metadata::

  type, extends(kernel_type) :: testkern_operator_type
     type(arg_type), dimension(2) :: meta_args =      &
          (/ arg_type(gh_operator, gh_write, w0, w1), &
             arg_type(gh_field*3,  gh_read,  w0) /)
     type(func_type) :: meta_funcs(1) =               &
          (/ func_type(w0, gh_basis) /)
     integer :: iterates_over = cells
     integer :: gh_shape = gh_evaluator
     integer :: gh_evaluator_targets(2) = (/W0, W1/)
   contains
     procedure, nopass :: code => testkern_operator_code
  end type testkern_operator_type

then we will need to pass two sets of basis functions (evaluated at ``W0``
and at ``W1``)::

  subroutine testkern_operator_code(cell, nlayers, ncell_3d,        &
       local_stencil, xdata, ydata, zdata, ndf_w0, undf_w0, map_w0, &
       basis_w0_on_w0, basis_w0_on_w1, ndf_w1)

If the metadata specifies that the kernel requires a property of the
reference element::

  type, extends(kernel_type) :: testkern_operator_type
     type(arg_type), dimension(2) :: meta_args =      &
          (/ arg_type(gh_operator, gh_write, w0, w1), &
             arg_type(gh_field*3, gh_read, w0) /)
     type(reference_element_data_type) :: meta_reference_element(1) =  &
          (/ reference_element_data_type(normals_to_horizontal_faces) /)
     integer :: iterates_over = cells
   contains
     procedure, nopass :: code => testkern_operator_code
  end type testkern_operator_type

Then the kernel must be passed the number of horizontal faces of the
reference element and the array of face normals::

  subroutine testkern_operator_code(cell, nlayers, ncell_3d,        &
       local_stencil, xdata, ydata, zdata, ndf_w0, undf_w0, map_w0, &
       nfaces_re_h, normals_face_h)

Rules for CMA Kernels
#####################

Kernels involving CMA operators are restricted to just three types;
assembly, application/inverse-application and matrix-matrix.
We give the rules for each of these in the sections below.

Assembly
^^^^^^^^

An assembly kernel requires the column-banded dofmap for both the to-
and from-function spaces of the CMA operator being assembled as well
as the number of DoFs for each of the dofmaps. The full set of rules is:

1) Include the ``cell`` argument. ``cell`` is an integer and has
   intent ``in``.

2) Include ``nlayers``, the number of layers in a column. ``nlayers``
   is an integer and has intent ``in``.

3) Include the number of cells in the 2D mesh, ``ncell_2d``, which is
   an integer with intent ``in``.

4) Include the total number of cells, ``ncell_3d``, which is an integer
   with intent ``in``.

5) For each argument in the ``meta_args`` metadata array:

   1) If it is a LMA operator, include a real, 3-dimensional
      array of type ``r_def``. The first two dimensions are the local
      degrees of freedom for the ``to`` and ``from`` spaces,
      respectively. The third dimension is ``ncell_3d``;

   2) If it is a CMA operator, include a real, 3-dimensional array
      of type ``r_def``. The first dimension is
      ``"bandwidth_"<operator_name>``, the second is
      ``"nrow_"<operator_name>``, and the third is ``ncell_2d``.

      1) Include the number of rows in the banded matrix.  This is
         an integer with intent ``in`` and is named as
         ``"nrow_"<operator_name>``.

      2) If the from-space of the operator is *not* the same as the
         to-space then include the number of columns in the banded
         matrix.  This is an integer with intent ``in`` and is named as
         ``"ncol_"<operator_name>``.

      3) Include the bandwidth of the banded matrix. This is an
         integer with intent ``in`` and is named as
         ``"bandwidth_"<operator_name>``.

      4) Include banded-matrix parameter ``alpha``. This is an integer
         with intent ``in`` and is named as ``"alpha_"<operator_name>``.

      5) Include banded-matrix parameter ``beta``. This is an integer
         with intent ``in`` and is named as ``"beta_"<operator_name>``.

      6) Include banded-matrix parameter ``gamma_m``. This is an integer
         with intent ``in`` and is named as ``"gamma_m_"<operator_name>``.

      7) Include banded-matrix parameter ``gamma_p``. This is an integer
         with intent ``in`` and is named as ``"gamma_p_"<operator_name>``.

   3) If it is a field or scalar argument then include arguments following
          the same rules as for general-purpose kernels.

6) For each unique function space in the order they appear in the
   metadata arguments (the ``to`` function space of an operator is
   considered to be before the ``from`` function space of the same
   operator as it appears first in lexicographic order):

   1) Include the number of degrees of freedom per cell for the space.
      This is an integer with intent ``in``. The name of this argument is
      ``"ndf_"<arg_function_space>``.

   2) If there is a field on this space then:

      1) Include the unique number of degrees of freedom for the
         function space. This is an integer and has intent ``in``.
         The name of this argument is ``"undf_"<field_function_space>``.

      2) Include the dofmap for this space. This is an integer array
         with intent ``in``. It has one dimension sized by the local
         degrees of freedom for the function space.

   3) If the CMA operator has this space as its to/from space then
      include the column-banded dofmap, the list of offsets for the
      to/from-space. This is an integer array of rank 2. The first
      dimension is ``"ndf_"<arg_function_space>```` and the second
      is ``nlayers``.


Application/Inverse-Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A kernel applying a CMA operator requires the column-indirection
dofmap for both the to- and from-function spaces of the CMA
operator. Since it does not have any LMA operator arguments it does
not require the ``ncell_3d`` and ``nlayers`` scalar arguments. (Since a
column-wise operator is, by definition, assembled for a whole column,
there is no loop over levels when applying it.)
The full set of rules is then:

1) Include the ``cell`` argument. ``cell`` is an integer and has
   intent ``in``.

2) Include the number of cells in the 2D mesh, ``ncell_2d``, which is
   an integer with intent ``in``.

3) For each argument in the ``meta_args`` metadata array:

   1) If it is a field, include the field array. This is a real
      array of kind ``r_def`` and is of rank 1.  The field array name
      is currently specified as being
      ``"field_"<argument_position>"_"<field_function_space>``. The
      extent of the array is the number of unique degrees of freedom
      for the function space that the field is on.  This value is
      passed in separately. The intent of the argument is determined
      from the metadata (see :ref:`dynamo0.3-api-meta-args`);

   2) If it is a CMA operator, include it and its associated
      parameters (see Rule 5 of CMA Assembly kernels).

4) For each of the unique function spaces encountered in the
   metadata arguments (the ``to`` function space of an operator
   is considered to be before the ``from`` function space of the
   same operator as it appears first in lexicographic order):

   1) Include the number of degrees of freedom per cell for the associated
      function space. This is an integer with intent ``in``. The name
      of this argument is ``"ndf_"<field_function_space>``;

   2) Include the number of unique degrees of freedom for the associated
      function space. This is an integer with intent ``in``. The name
      of this argument is ``"undf_"<field_function_space>``;

   3) Include the dofmap for this function space. This is a rank-1 integer
      array with extent equal to the number of degrees of freedom of
      the space (``"ndf_"<field_function_space>``).

5) Include the indirection map for the to-space of the CMA operator.
   This is a rank-1 integer array with extent ``nrow``.

6) If the from-space of the operator is *not* the same as the to-space
   then include the indirection map for the from-space of the CMA operator.
   This is a rank-1 integer array with extent ``ncol``.

Matrix-Matrix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Does not require any dofmaps and also does not require the ``nlayers``
and ``ncell_3d`` scalar arguments. The full set of rules are then:

1) Include the ``cell`` argument. ``cell`` is an integer and has
   intent ``in``.

2) Include the number of cells in the 2D mesh, ``ncell_2d``, which is
   an integer with intent ``in``.

3) For each CMA operator or scalar argument specifed in metadata:

   1) If it is a CMA operator, include it and its associated
      parameters (see Rule 5 of CMA Assembly kernels);

   2) If it is a scalar argument include the corresponding Fortran
      variable in the argument list with intent ``in``.

Rules for Inter-Grid Kernels
############################

As already specified, inter-grid kernels are only permitted to take
fields and/or field-vectors as arguments. Fields (and field-vectors)
that are on different meshes must be on different function
spaces. Fields on the same mesh must also be on the same function
space.

Argument ordering follows the general pattern used for 'normal'
kernels with field data being followed by dofmap data. The rules for
arguments to inter-grid kernels are as follows:

1) Include ``nlayers``, the number of layers in a column. ``nlayers``
   is an integer and has intent ``in``.

2) Include the ``cell_map`` for the current cell (column). This is
   an integer array of rank one and intent ``in`` which provides
   the mapping from the coarse to the fine mesh. It has extent
   `ncell_f_per_c`.

3) Include ``ncell_f_per_c``, the number of fine cells per coarse cell.
   This is an integer and has intent ``in``.

4) Include ``ncell_f``, the number of cells (columns) in the fine mesh.
   This is an integer and has intent ``in``.

5) For each argument in the ``meta_args`` metadata array (which must be
   a field or field-vector):

   1) Pass in field data as done for a regular kernel.

6) For each unique function space (of which there will currently be two)
   in the order in which they are encountered in the ``meta_args``
   metadata array, include dofmap information:

   If the dofmap is associated with an argument on the fine mesh:

   1) Include ``ndf_fine``, the number of DoFs per cell for the FS of
      the field on the fine mesh;

   2) Include ``undf_fine``, the number of unique DoFs per cell for the FS
          of the field on the fine mesh;

   3) Include ``dofmap_fine``, the *whole* dofmap for the fine mesh. This
      is an integer array of rank two with intent ``in``. The extent of
      the first dimension is ``ndf_fine`` and that of the second is
      ``ncell_f``.

   else, the dofmap is associated with an argument on the coarse mesh:

   1) Include ``undf_coarse``, the number of unique DoFs
      for the coarse field. This is an integer with intent ``in``;

   2) Include ``dofmap_coarse``, the dofmap for the current cell (column)
      in the coarse mesh. This is an integer array of rank one and has
      intent ``in``.

.. _dynamo0.3-built-ins:

Built-ins
---------

The basic concept of a PSyclone Built-in is described in the
:ref:`built-ins` section.  In the Dynamo0.3 API, calls to
Built-ins generally follow a convention that the field/scalar written
to comes first in the argument list. Dynamo0.3 Built-ins must conform to the
following four rules:

1) Built-in kernels must have one and only one modified (i.e. written
   to) argument.

2) There must be at least one field in the argument list. This is so
   that we know the number of DoFs to iterate over.

3) Kernel arguments must be either fields or scalars.

4) All field arguments to a given Built-in must be on the same
   function space. This is because all current Built-ins iterate over
   DoFs and therefore all fields should have the same number. It also
   means that we can determine the number of DoFs uniquely when a
   scalar is written to.

The Built-ins supported for the Dynamo0.3 API are listed in the related
subsections, grouped by the mathematical operation they perform. For clarity,
the calculation performed by each Built-in is described using Fortran array
syntax; this does not necessarily reflect the actual implementation of the
Built-in (*e.g.* it could be implemented by PSyclone generating a call to an
optimised maths library).

Naming scheme
+++++++++++++

The supported Built-ins in the Dynamo0.3 API are named according to the
scheme presented below. Any new Built-in needs to comply with these rules.

1) Ordering of arguments in Built-ins calls follows
   *LHS (result) <- RHS (operation on arguments)*
   direction, except where a Built-in returns the *LHS* result to one of
   the *RHS* arguments. In that case ordering of arguments remains as in
   the *RHS* expression, with the returning *RHS* argument written as close
   to the *LHS* as it can be without affecting the mathematical expression.

2) Field names begin with upper case in short form (e.g. **X**, **Y**,
   **Z**) and any case in long form (e.g. **Field1**, **field**).

3) Scalar names begin with lower case:  e.g. **a**, **b**, are **scalar1**,
   **scalar2**. Special names for scalars are: **constant** (or **c**),
   **innprod** (inner/scalar product of two fields) and **sumfld**
   (sum of a field).

4) Arguments in Built-ins variable declarations and constructs (PSyclone
   Fortran and Python definitions):

   1) Are always  written in long form and lower case (e.g. **field1**,
      **field2**, **scalar1**, **scalar2**);

   2) *LHS* result arguments are always listed first;

   3) *RHS* arguments are listed in order of appearance in the mathematical
      expression, except when one of them is the *LHS* result.

5) Built-ins names in Fortran consist of:

   1) *RHS* arguments in short form (e.g. **X**, **Y**, **a**, **b**) only;

   2) Descriptive name of mathematical operation on *RHS* arguments in the
      form  ``<operationname>_<RHSarg>`` for one *RHS* argument or
      ``<RHSargs>_<operationname>_<RHSargs>`` for more;

   3) Prefix ``"inc_"`` where the result is returned to one of the *RHS*
      arguments (i.e. ``"inc_"<RHSargs>_<operationname>_<RHSargs>``).

   counterparts, with a few differences:

   1) Operators and *RHS* arguments are all in upper case (e.g. **X**,
      **Y**, **A**, **B**, **Plus**, **Minus**);

   2) There are no underscores;

   3) Common prefix is ``"Dyn"``, common suffix is ``"Kern"``.

Boundary Conditions
-------------------

In the Dynamo0.3 API, boundary conditions for a field or LMA operator can
be enforced by the algorithm developer by calling the Kernels
``enforce_bc_type`` or ``enforce_operator_bc_type``,
respectively. These kernels take a field or operator as input and apply
boundary conditions. For example:

::

  call invoke( kernel_type(field1, field2),      &
               enforce_bc_type(field1),          &
               kernel_with_op_type(field1, op1), &
               enforce_operator_bc_type(op1)     &
             )

The particular boundary conditions that are applied are not known by
PSyclone, PSyclone simply recognises these kernels by their names and passes
pre-specified dofmap and boundary_value arrays into the kernel
implementations, the contents of which are set by the LFRic
infrastructure.

Up to and including version 1.4.0 of PSyclone, boundary conditions
were applied automatically after a call to ``matrix_vector_type`` if
the field arguments were on a vector function space (one of ``W1``,
``W2``, ``W2H``, ``W2V`` or ``W2broken``). With the subsequent introduction
of the ability to apply boundary conditions to operators this functionality
is no longer required and has been removed.

Example ``eg4`` in the ``examples/lfric`` directory includes a call
to ``enforce_bc_kernel_type`` so can be used to see the boundary condition
code that is added by PSyclone. See the ``README`` in the
``examples/lfric`` directory for instructions on how to run this
example.

An example of applying boundary conditions to an operator is the kernel
``enforce_operator_bc_kernel_mod.F90`` in the
``<PSYCLONEHOME>/src/psyclone/tests/test_files/dynamo0p3`` directory.
Since operators are discontinuous quantities, updating their values can
be safely performed in parallel (see Section :ref:`dynamo0.3-kernel`).
The ``GH_READWRITE`` access is used for updating discontinuous operators
(see subsection :ref:`dynamo0.3-valid-access` for more details).

Conventions
-----------

The naming of Dynamo0.3 API kernels and associated entities (types,
subroutines and modules) follows the PSyclone Fortran naming
conventions (see :ref:`fortran_naming`). However, PSyclone does not need
this convention to be followed apart from the stub generator (see the
:ref:`stub-generation` Section ) where the name of the metadata to be
parsed is determined from the module name.

The contents of the metadata is also usually declared private but this
does not affect PSyclone.

Finally, the ``procedure`` metadata (located within the kernel
metadata) usually has ``nopass`` specified but again this is ignored
by PSyclone.

.. _dynamo0.3-api-configuration:

Configuration
-------------

Annexed DoFs
++++++++++++

When a kernel iterates over DoFs (rather than cells) for a continuous
field using distributed memory (see the :ref:`distributed_memory`
Section), then PSyclone need only ensure that DoFs owned by a
processor are computed. However, for continuous fields, shared DoFs at
the boundary between processors must be replicated (as different cells
share the same DoF). Only one processor can own a DoF, therefore
processors will have continuous fields which contain DoFs that the
processor does not own. These unowned DoFs are called `annexed` in the
Dynamo0.3 API and are a separate, but related, concept to field halos.

When a kernel that iterates over cells needs to read a continuous
field then the annexed DoFs must be up-to-date on all processors. If
they are not then a halo exchange must be added. Currently PSyclone
defaults, for kernels which iterate over DoFs, to iterating over only
owned DoFs. This behaviour can be changed by setting
`COMPUTE_ANNEXED_DOFS` to ``true`` in the `dynamo0.3` section of the
configuration file (see the :ref:`configuration` section). PSyclone
will then generate code to iterate over both owned and annexed DoFs,
thereby reducing the number of halo exchanges required (at the expense
of redundantly computing annexed DoFs). For more details please refer
to the :ref:`dynamo0.3-developers` developers section.

.. _dynamo0.3-api-transformations:

Transformations
---------------

This section describes the Dynamo0.3-API-specific transformations. In
cases, excepting **Dynamo0p3RedundantComputationTrans**,
**Dynamo0p3AsyncHaloExchangeTrans** and **Dynamo0p3KernelConstTrans**,
these transformations are specialisations of generic transformations
described in the :ref:`transformations` section. The difference
between these transformations and the generic ones is that these
perform Dynamo0.3-API-specific checks to make sure the transformations
are valid. In practice these transformations perform the required
checks then call the generic ones internally.

The use of the Dynamo0.3-API-specific transformations is exactly the
same as the equivalent generic ones in all cases excepting
**DynamoLoopFuseTrans**. In this case an additional optional argument
**same_space** can be set after creating an instance of the transformation.
The reason for this is to allow loop fusion when one or more of the
iteration spaces is determined by a function space that is unknown by
PSyclone at compile time. This is the case when the ``ANY_SPACE_n``
function space is specified in the Kernel metadata. Setting
``ftrans.same_space = True`` allows the user to specify that the spaces are
the same. This option should therefore be used with caution. PSyclone will
raise an error if **same_space** is used when at least one of the function
spaces is not ``ANY_SPACE_n`` or both spaces are not the same. As a general
PSyclone will not allow loop fusion if it does not know the spaces
are the same. The exception are loops over discontinuous spaces (see
:ref:`dynamo0.3-function-space` for list of discontinuous function spaces)
for which loop fusion is allowed (unless the loop bounds become different
due to a prior transformation).

The **Dynamo0p3RedundantComputationTrans** and
**Dynamo0p3AsyncHaloExchange** transformations are only valid for the
Dynamo0.3 API. This is because this API is currently the only one
that supports distributed memory.  An example of redundant computation
can be found in ``examples/lfric/eg8`` and an example of asynchronous
halo exchanges can be found in ``examples/lfric/eg11``.

The **Dynamo0p3KernelConstTrans** transformation is only valid for the
Dynamo0.3 API. This is because the properties that it makes constant
are API specific.

The Dynamo0.3-API-specific transformations currently available are given
below. If the name of a transformation includes "Dynamo0p3" it means
that the transformation is only valid for this particular API. If the
name of the transformation includes "Dynamo" then it should work with
all versions of the Dynamo API.

.. note:: Only the loop-colouring and OpenMP transformations are currently
          supported for loops that contain inter-grid kernels. Attempting
          to apply other transformation types will result in PSyclone raising
          an error.
