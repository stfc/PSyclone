Examples
========

Various examples of the use of PSyclone are provided under the
``examples`` directory in the git repository. If you have installed
PSyclone using pip then the examples may be found in
``share/psyclone/examples`` under your Python installation
(e.g. ``~/.local`` for a user-local installation).

Running any of these examples requires that PSyclone be installed on
the host system, see :ref:`getting-going`. This section is intended
to provide an overview of the various examples so that a user can find
one that is appropriate to them. For details of how to run each
example please see the ``README.md`` files in the associated directories.

Alternatively, some of the examples have associated Jupyter notebooks
that may be launched with Binder on `MyBinder <https://mybinder.org/>`_.
This is most easily done by following the links from the top-level
`README <https://github.com/stfc/PSyclone#try-it-on-binder>`_.

For the purposes of correctness checking, the whole suite of examples
may be executed using Gnu ``make`` (this functionality is used by GitHub
Actions alongside the test suite). The default target is ``transform`` which
just performs the PSyclone code transformation steps for each
example. For those examples that support it, the ``compile`` target
also requests that the generated code be compiled. The ``notebook``
target checks the various Jupyter notebooks using ``nbconvert``.

.. note:: if you have copied the examples directory to some other
	  location but still wish to use ``make`` then you will also
	  have to set the ``PSYCLONE_CONFIG`` environment variable to
	  the full path to the PSyclone configuration file, e.g.
	  ``$ PSYCLONE_CONFIG=/some/path/psyclone.cfg make``

Each of the Makefiles also provides the ``clean`` and ``allclean``
targets.  The former simply removes all generated files while the
latter also cleans each of the infrastructure libraries used when
compiling the examples (``dl_timer``, ``dl_esm_inf`` and the various
PSyData wrapper libraries).

GOcean
------

Example 1: Loop transformations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Examples of applying various transformations (loop fusion, OpenMP,
OpenACC, OpenCL) to the semi-PSyKAl'd version of the Shallow
benchmark. ("semi" because not all kernels are called from within
invoke()'s.) Also includes an example of generating a DAG from an
InvokeSchedule.

Example 2: OpenACC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a simple but complete example of using PSyclone to enable an
application to run on a GPU by adding OpenACC directives. A Makefile
is included which will use PSyclone to generate the PSy code and
transformed kernels and then compile the application. This compilation
requires that the dl_esm_inf library (github.com/stfc/dl_esm_inf) be
installed/available - it is provided as a git submodule of the PSyclone
project (see :ref:`dev_guide:dev-installation` in the Developers' Guide
for details on working with submodules).

The supplied Makefile also provides a second, "profile" target which
performs the same OpenACC transformations but then encloses the whole
of the resulting PSy layer in a profiling region. By linking this with
the PSyclone NVTX profiling wrapper (and the NVTX library itself), the
resulting application can be profiled using NVIDIA's `nvprof` or
`nvvp` tools.

Example 3: OpenCL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Example of the use of PSyclone to generate an OpenCL driver version of
the PSy layer and OpenCL kernels. The Makefile in this example provides
a target (`make compile-ocl`) to compile the generated OpenCL code. This
requires an OpenCL implementation installed in the system. Read the README
provided in the example folder for more details about how to compile and
execute the generated OpenCL code.

Example 4: Kernels containing use statements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Transforming kernels for use with either OpenACC or OpenCL requires
that we handle those that access data and/or routines via module
``use`` statements. This example shows the various forms for which
support is being implemented. Although there is support for converting
global-data accesses into kernel arguments, PSyclone does not yet support
nested ``use`` of modules (i.e. data accessed via a module that in turn
imports that symbol from another module) and kernels that call other
kernels (Issue #342).


Example 5: PSyData
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This directory contains all examples that use the
:ref:`PSyData API<psy_Data>`. At this stage there are three
runnable examples:

Example 5.1: Kernel data extraction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This example shows the use of kernel data extraction in PSyclone.
It instruments each of the two invokes in the example program
with the PSyData-based kernel extraction code.
It uses the dl_esm_inf-specific extraction library 'netcdf'
(``lib/extract/netcdf/dl_esm_inf``), and needs NetCDF to be
available (including ``nf-config`` to detect installation-specific
paths). You need to compile the NetCDF extraction library
(see :ref:`psyke_netcdf`).
The makefile in this example will link with the compiled NetCDF
extraction library and NetCDF. You can execute the created
binary and it will create two output netcdf files, one for
each of the two invokes.

It will also create two stand-alone driver programs (one for
each invoke), that will read the corresponding NetCDF file,
and then executes the original code.

.. note::
    At this stage the driver program will not compile
    (see issue #644).


Example 5.2: Profiling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This example shows how to use the profiling support in PSyclone.
It instruments two invoke statements and can link in with any
of the following profiling wrapper libraries: template,
simple_timer, dl_timer, and DrHook (see
:ref:`profiling_third_party_tools`). The ``README.md``
file contains detailed instructions on how to build the
different executables. By default (i.e. just using ``make``
without additional parameters) it links in with the
template profiling library included in PSyclone. This library just
prints out the name of the module and region before and after each
invoke is executed. This example can actually be executed to
test the behaviour of the various profiling wrappers, and is
also useful if you want to develop your own wrapper libraries.

.. _gocean_example_readonly:

Example 5.3: Read-only-verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This example shows the use of read-only-verification with PSyclone.
It instruments each of the two invokes in the example program
with the PSyData-based read-only-verification code.
It uses the dl_esm_inf-specific read-only-verification library
(``lib/read_only/dl_esm_inf/``).

.. note::

    The ``update_field_mod`` subroutine contains some very
    buggy and non-standard code to change the value of some
    read-only variables and fields, even though the variables
    are all declared with
    ``intent(in)``. It uses the addresses of variables and
    then out-of-bound writes to a writeable array to
    actually overwrite the read-only variables. Using
    array bounds checking at runtime will be triggered by these
    out-of-bound writes.

The makefile in this example will link with the compiled 
read-only-verification library. You can execute the created
binary and it will print two warnings about modified
read-only variables:

.. code-block:: none

    --------------------------------------
    Double precision field b_fld has been modified in main : update
    Original checksum:   4611686018427387904
    New checksum:        4638355772470722560
    --------------------------------------
    --------------------------------------
    Double precision variable z has been modified in main : update
    Original value:    1.0000000000000000     
    New value:         123.00000000000000     
    --------------------------------------

Example 6: PSy-layer Code Creation using PSyIR
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This example informs the development of the code generation of PSy-layer
code using the PSyIR language backends.


.. _examples_lfric:

LFRic
------

Examples 1 and 2 are for the (deprecated) Dynamo 0.1 API. The remaining
examples are all for the Dynamo 0.3 API.

Example 1
^^^^^^^^^

Basic operation of PSyclone with invoke()'s containing just one kernel
for the Dynamo 0.1 API. Also includes an example of transforming for
OpenMP.

Example 2
^^^^^^^^^

A more complex example for the Dynamo 0.1 API containing multi-kernel
invokes. Provides examples of OpenMP and loop fusion transformations.

Example 3
^^^^^^^^^

Shows the use of colouring and OpenMP for the Dynamo 0.3 API. Includes
multi-kernel, named invokes with both user-supplied and built-in
kernels. Also shows the use of ``Wchi`` function space metadata for
coordinate fields in LFRic.

Example 4
^^^^^^^^^

Demonstrates the use of the special ``enforce_bc_kernel`` which
PSyclone recognises as a boundary-condition kernel.

Example 5
^^^^^^^^^

Example of kernels which require stencil information.

Example 6
^^^^^^^^^

Example of applying OpenMP to an InvokeSchedule containing kernels
that perform reduction operations. Two scripts are provided, one of
which demonstrates how to request that PSyclone generate code for a
reproducible OpenMP reduction. (The default OpenMP reduction is not
guaranteed to be reproducible from one run to the next on the same
number of threads.)

Example 7
^^^^^^^^^

Example of kernels requiring Column-Matrix Assembly operators.

Example 8
^^^^^^^^^

Example of the use of the redundant-computation and move
transformations to eliminate and re-order halo exchanges.

Example 9
^^^^^^^^^

Demonstrates the behaviour of PSyclone for kernels that read and write
quantities on horizontally-discontinuous function spaces. In addition,
this example demonstrates how to write a PSyclone transformation script
that only colours loops over continuous spaces.

Example 10
^^^^^^^^^^

Demonstrates the use of "inter-grid" kernels that prolong or restrict
fields (map between grids of different resolutions), as well as the
use of ``ANY_DISCONTINUOUS_SPACE`` function space metadata.

Example 11
^^^^^^^^^^

Example of the use of transformations to introduce redundant computation,
split synchronous halo exchanges into asynchronous exchanges (start and
stop) and move the starts of those exchanges in order to overlap them
with computation.

Example 12
^^^^^^^^^^

Example of applying code extraction to Nodes in an Invoke Schedule:

.. code-block:: bash

  > psyclone -nodm -s ./extract_nodes.py \
      gw_mixed_schur_preconditioner_alg_mod.x90

or to a Kernel in an Invoke after applying transformations:

.. code-block:: bash

  > psyclone -nodm -s ./extract_kernel_with_transformations.py \
      gw_mixed_schur_preconditioner_alg_mod.x90

For now it only inserts comments in appropriate locations while the
the full support for code extraction is being developed.

This example also contains a Python helper script ``find_kernel.py``
which displays the names and Schedules of Invokes containing call(s)
to the specified Kernel:

.. code-block:: bash

  > python find_kernel.py

Example 13 : Kernel transformation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Demonstrates how an LFRic kernel can be transformed. The example
transformation makes Kernel values constant where appropriate. For
example, the number of levels is usually passed into a kernel by
argument but the transformation allows a particular value to be
specified which the transformation then sets as a parameter in the
kernel. Hard-coding values in a kernel helps the compiler to do a
better job when optimising the code.

Example 14: OpenACC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Example of adding OpenACC directives in the dynamo0.3 API. This is a
work in progress so the generated code may not work as
expected. However it is never-the-less useful as a starting
point. Three scripts are provided.

The first script (``acc_kernels.py``) shows how to add OpenACC Kernels
directives to the PSy-layer. This example only works with distributed
memory switched off as the OpenACC Kernels transformation does not yet
support halo exchanges within an OpenACC Kernels region.

The second script (``acc_parallel.py``)shows how to add OpenACC Loop,
Parallel and Enter Data directives to the PSy-layer. Again this
example only works with distributed memory switched off as the OpenACC
Parallel transformation does not support halo exchanges within an
OpenACC Parallel region.

The third script (``acc_parallel_dm.py``) is the same as the second
except that it does support distributed memory being switched on by
placing an OpenACC Parallel directive around each OpenACC Loop
directive, rather than having one for the whole invoke. This approach
avoids having halo exchanges within an OpenACC Parallel region.

The generated code has a number of problems including 1) it does not
modify the kernels to include the OpenACC Routine directive, 2) a
loop's upper bound is computed via a derived type (this should be
computed beforehand) 3) set_dirty and set_clean calls are placed
within an OpenACC Parallel directive and 4) there are no checks on
whether loops are parallel or not, it is just assumed they are -
i.e. support for colouring or locking is not yet implemented.

Example 15: CPU Optimisation of Matvec
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Example of optimising the LFRic matvec kernel for CPUs. This is work
in progress with the idea being that PSyclone transformations will be
able to reproduce hand-optimised code.

There is one script which, when run:

.. code-block:: bash

   > psyclone ./matvec_opt.py ../code/gw_mixed_schur_preconditioner_alg_mod.x90

will print out the modified matvec kernel code. At the moment no
transformations are included (as they are work-in-progress) so the
code that is output is the same as the original (but looks different
as it has been translated to PSyIR and then output by the PSyIR
fortran back-end).

Example 16: Kernel Extraction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The subdirectory ``full_example_extract`` contains a runnable example
of LFRic code that creates a NetCDF file with the input and output
parameters of a simple kernel. This example requires the installation
of a Fortran compiler and NetCDF development environment. After compilation
of the code, you can run the example. which will produce a NetCDF file:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd full_example_extraction
    make
    ./extract
    ncdump ./main-update.nc | less



NEMO
----

These examples may all be found in the ``examples/nemo`` directory.

Example 1: OpenMP parallelisation of tra_adv
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Demonstrates the use of PSyclone to parallelise the loops over vertical levels
in a NEMO tracer-advection benchmark using OpenMP.

Example 2: OpenMP parallelisation of traldf_iso
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Demonstrates the use of PSyclone to parallelise the loops over vertical levels
in some NEMO tracer-diffusion code using OpenMP.

Example 3: OpenACC parallelisation of tra_adv
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Demonstrates the introduction of simple OpenACC parallelisation (using the
``data`` and ``kernels`` directives) for a NEMO tracer-advection benchmark.

.. _nemo-eg4-sir:

Example 4: Transforming Fortran code to the SIR
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Demonstrates that simple Fortran code examples which conform to the
NEMO API can be transformed to the Stencil Intermediate Representation
(SIR). The SIR is the front-end language to DAWN
(https://github.com/MeteoSwiss-APN/dawn), a tool which generates
optimised cuda, or gridtools code. Thus these simple Fortran examples
can be transformed to optimised cuda and/or gridtools code by using
PSyclone and then DAWN.

PSyIR
-----

Examples may all be found in the ``example/psyir`` directory. Read the
``README.md`` file in this directory for full details.

Example 1: Constructing PSyIR and Generating Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``create.py`` is a Python script that demonstrates the use of the various
``create`` methods to build a PSyIR tree from scratch.

Example 2: Creating PSyIR for Structure Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``create_structure_types.py`` demonstrates the representation of
structure types (i.e. Fortran derived types or C structs) in the PSyIR.
