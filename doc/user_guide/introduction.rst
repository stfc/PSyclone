Introduction
============

PSyclone, the PSy code generator, is being developed for use in finite
element, finite volume and finite difference codes. PSyclone development
started with the aim to support the emerging API in the GungHo project
for a finite element dynamical core.

The `GungHo project
<https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/foundation/dynamics/next-generation>`_
was initiated in 2011 to address challenges of weather and climate
prediction on the next generation of supercomputers. The project ran for
5 years as a collaboration between the Met Office, NERC (via NERC funded
academics) and STFC. It laid a foundation for redesign of the heart of
the Met Office's Unified Model, known as the dynamical core, from the
choices of numerical methods and model grids to the implementation of
parallel algorithms that will scale to millions of cores.

The software infrastructure based on the GungHo project recommendations
is now being developed in the
`LFRic project <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/modelling-systems/lfric>`_
and is expected to is expected to start preparations for operational
deployment in 2025. Its development is led by the requirements to support
multiple meshes and element types, thus allowing for future model development.

GungHo also proposed a novel separation of concerns for the software
implementation of the dynamical core. This approach distinguishes between
three layers: the Algorithm layer, the Kernel layer and the Parallelisation
System (PSy) layer. Together this separation is termed PSyKAl.

The Algorithm layer specifies the algorithm that the scientist would
like to run (in terms of calls to kernel routines and built-in operations)
and logically operates on full fields.

The Kernel layer provides the implementation of the code kernels as
subroutines. These subroutines operate on local fields (a set of
elements, a vertical column, or a set of vertical columns, depending
on the kernel).

The PSy layer sits in-between the algorithm and kernel layers and its
primary role is to provide node-based parallel performance for the target
architecture. The PSy layer can be optimised for a particular hardware
architecture, such as multi-core, many-core, GPGPUs, or some
combination thereof with no change to the algorithm or kernel layer
code. This approach therefore offers the potential for portable
performance.

Rather than writing the PSy layer manually, the PSyclone code generation
system can help a user to optimise the code for a particular architecture
(by providing optimisations such as blocking, loop merging, inlining etc),
or alternatively, generate the PSy layer automatically.

PSyclone is also being extended to support an API being developed in
the `GOcean project <https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/publications/case-studies/2016/07/15/developing-next-generation-ocean-modelling-techniques>` for two finite
difference ocean model benchmarks, one of which is based on the
`NEMO <https://www.nemo-ocean.eu/>`_ ocean model.
