Tutorial
========

PSyclone provides a tutorial, part of which uses Jupyter notebooks. This can be
launched from a browser using binder:
`<https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/stfc/psyclone/master?filepath=tutorial%2Fnotebooks%2Fintroduction.ipynb/>`_.

If PSyclone is installed on your system then you can run the tutorial
locally. First find the tutorial. If you have installed PSyclone using
``pip`` then the examples may be found in ``share/psyclone/tutorial/notebooks``
under your Python installation (see :ref:`here <getting-going-env-loc>` for
possible locations). Next, copy the tutorial to a local writable space (as
the notebooks will be modified as you go through the tutorial) and
change directory to this tutorial. Lastly, start up the tutorial's
introduction ``jupyter-notebook introduction.ipynb``.

Another part of the tutorial are `practicals
<https://github.com/stfc/PSyclone/tree/master/tutorial/practicals>`_
that provide hands-on introductions to various functionality contained in the
:ref:`LFRic <dynamo0.3-api>` and :ref:`NEMO <nemo-api>` APIs. The sections
in the included directories are worked through using PSyclone in a "normal"
Linux environment.

.. note:: Hands-on practicals are not currently included in a
          PSyclone installation.
