Getting Going
=============

.. _getting-going-download:

Installation
------------

The following instructions are intended for a PSyclone user who wants
to work with a released version of the code. If you are a developer or
wish to test a specific branch of PSyclone from the GitHub repository
please see the
:ref:`Installation section in the Developer Guide <dev-installation>`.

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: From PyPI:

    For a system-wide installation use:

    .. code-block:: bash

      pip install psyclone

    For a user-local installation use:

    .. code-block:: bash

      pip install --user psyclone

    For a specific release (where ``X.Y.Z`` is the release version) use:

    .. code-block:: bash

      pip install psyclone==X.Y.Z


    For more information about using ``pip`` or encapsulating the installation
    in its own ``virtual environment`` we recommend reading the
    `Python Packaging User Guide <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/>`_.

  .. tab:: From Spack:

    To install psyclone to your loaded Spack installation use:

    .. code-block:: bash

      spack install psyclone


    For more information about how to use Spack we recommend reading the
    `Spack documentation <https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/>`_.

  .. tab:: From Source:

    To download and install a specific PSyclone release (where ``X.Y.Z`` is the release version)
    from source, use:

    .. code-block:: bash

       wget https://github.com/stfc/PSyclone/archive/X.Y.Z.tar.gz
       tar zxf X.Y.Z.tar.gz
       cd PSyclone-X.Y.Z
       pip install .


.. _getting-going-install-loc:

Installation location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PSyclone installation location will vary depending on the specific installation
method and options used. The ``psyclone`` command will typically already be
prepended to your ``PATH`` after following the instructions above, but sometimes
you will need to source the virtual environment or load the Spack module again
after restarting your terminal.

Once psyclone is in your `PATH` you can execute ``which psyclone`` to see
the installation directory. Some supporting files such as configuration,
examples and instrumentation libraries are installed under the ``share/psyclone``
directory relative to the psyclone installation. You can replace
``bin/psyclone`` in the string returned by ``which psyclone`` with
``share/psyclone`` to find their location.


.. _getting-going-configuration:

Configuration
-------------

Various aspects of PSyclone are controlled through a configuration
file, ``psyclone.cfg``.  The default version of this file is located in
the ``share/psyclone/psyclone.cfg`` file in the :ref:`getting-going-install-loc`.

.. warning::

   If PSyclone is installed in 'editable' mode (``-e`` flag to ``pip``),
   or in a non-standard location, then PSyclone will not be able to find the
   default configuration file. There are two solutions to this:

   1. copy a configuration file to the location specified above.

   2. set the ``PSYCLONE_CONFIG`` environment variable (or the ``--config``
   flag) to the full-path to the configuration file, e.g.:

   .. code-block:: bash

     export PSYCLONE_CONFIG=/some/path/PSyclone/config/psyclone.cfg


See :ref:`configuration` for more details about the settings contained
within the config file.


.. _getting-going-run:

Running PSyclone
----------------

You are now ready to run PSyclone. One way of doing this is to use the ``psyclone``
command. To list the available options run: ``psyclone -h``, it should output::

   usage: psyclone [-h] [--version] [--config CONFIG] [-s SCRIPT] [-I INCLUDE]
                   [-l {off,all,output}] [--profile {invokes,routines,kernels}]
				   [--backend {enable-validation,disable-validation}] [-o OUTPUT_FILE]
				   [-api DSL] [-oalg OUTPUT_ALGORITHM_FILE] [-opsy OUTPUT_PSY_FILE]
                   [-okern OUTPUT_KERNEL_PATH] [-d DIRECTORY] [-dm] [-nodm]
                   [--kernel-renaming {multiple,single}]
                   filename

   Transform a file using the PSyclone source-to-source Fortran compiler

   positional arguments:
     filename              input source code

   options:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     --version, -v         display version information
     --config CONFIG, -c CONFIG

     -l {off,all,output}, --limit {off,all,output}
                           limit the Fortran line length to 132 characters (default 'off').
                           Use 'all' to apply limit to both input and output Fortran. Use
                           'output' to apply line-length limit to output Fortran only.
     --profile {invokes,routines,kernels}, -p {invokes,routines,kernels}
                           add profiling hooks for 'kernels', 'invokes' or 'routines'
     --backend {enable-validation,disable-validation}

                           (psykal mode) path to a root directory structure containing kernel
                           source code. Multiple roots can be specified by using multiple -d
                           arguments.
     -dm, --dist_mem       (psykal mode) generate distributed memory code
     -nodm, --no_dist_mem  (psykal mode) do not generate distributed memory code
     --kernel-renaming {multiple,single}
                           (psykal mode) naming scheme to use when re-naming transformed kernels

There is more detailed information about each flag in :ref:`psyclone_command` section,
but the main parameters are the input source file that we aim to transform, and a transformation
recipe that is provided with the ``-s`` flag.
In addition to these, note that psyclone can be used in two distinct modes:
the code-transformation mode (when no ``-api``/``--psykal-dsl`` flags are provided) or the
PSyKAl DSL mode (when a ``-api``/``--psykal-dsl`` flag is provided). The following sections provide
a brief introduction to each mode.

PSyclone for Code Transformation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using PSyclone for transforming existing Fortran files, only an
input source file is required:

.. code-block:: console

    psyclone input_file.f90


However, we usually want to redirect the output to a file so that we can later
compile it. We can do this using the `-o` flag:

.. code-block:: console

    psyclone input_file.f90 -o output.f90


This should not transform the semantics of the code (only the syntax), and is
what we sometimes refer to as a "passthrough" run. This can be useful as an initial
correctness test when applying PSyclone to a new code.

However, PSyclone allows users to programatically change the source code of the
processed file. This is achieved using transformation recipes which are python scripts
with a `trans` function defined. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    def trans(psyir):
        ''' Add OpenMP Parallel Loop directives.

        :param psyir: the PSyIR of the provided file.
        :type psyir: :py:class:`psyclone.psyir.nodes.FileContainer`

        '''
        omp_trans = TransInfo().get_trans_name('OMPParallelLoopTrans')

        for loop in psyir.walk(Loop):
            try:
                omp_trans.apply(loop)
            except TransformationError as err:
                print(f"Loop not paralellised because: {err.value}")


.. warning::

   Before PSyclone 3.0 the transformation scripts took a PSy object as argument:

   .. code-block:: python

       def trans(psy):
           ''' Add OpenMP Parallel Loop directives.

           :param psy: the PSy object that PSyclone has constructed for the
                       'invoke'(s) found in the Algorithm file.
           :type psy: :py:class:`psyclone.dynamo0p3.DynamoPSy`

           '''
           for invoke in psy.invokes.invoke_list:
              invoke.schedule

   This is deprecated and will stop working in PSyclone releases post version 3.0


And can be applied using the `-s` flag:

.. code-block:: console

    psyclone input_file.f90 -s trans_script.py -o output.f90


To see more complete examples of PSyclone for code transformation, see the
``examples/nemo`` folder in the PSyclone repository.

PSyclone for PSyKAl DSLs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As indicated above, the ``psyclone`` command can also be used to process PSyKAl
DSLs (``--psykal-dsl`` flag). In this case the command takes as input the Fortran
source file containing the algorithm specification (in terms
of calls to ``invoke()``). It parses this, finds the necessary kernel
source files and produces two Fortran files. The first contains the
:ref:`middle, PSy-layer <PSy-layer>` and the second a re-write of the
:ref:`algorithm code <algorithm-layer>` to use that layer. These files
are named according to the user-supplied arguments (options ``-opsy``
and ``-oalg`` respectively). If those arguments are not supplied then the script
writes the re-written Fortran Algorithm layer to the terminal. For details of the other
command-line arguments please see the :ref:`psyclone_command` Section.

Examples are provided in the ``examples/lfric`` and ``examples/gocean`` directories
of the PSyclone repository. Alternatively, if you have installed PSyclone using
``pip`` then they may be found in the ``share/psyclone`` directory under your
PSyclone installation (see `which psyclone` for the location of the
PSyclone installation).
In this case you should copy the whole ``examples`` directory to some
convenient location before attempting to carry out the following instructions.

In this case we are going to use one of the LFRic examples:

.. code-block:: console

    cd <EGS_HOME>/examples/lfric/eg1
    psyclone --psykal-dsl lfric -d ../code -nodm -oalg alg.f90 \
        -opsy psy.f90 ./single_invoke.x90


You should see two new files created, called ``alg.f90`` (containing
the re-written algorithm layer) and ``psy.f90`` (containing the
generated PSy- or middle-layer). Since this is an LFRic example the
Fortran source code has dependencies on the LFRic system and
therefore cannot be compiled stand-alone.

The PSy-layer that PSyclone creates is constructed using the PSyclone Internal
Representation (:ref:`PSyIR <psyir-ug>`). Accessing this is demonstrated
by the ``print_psyir_trans.py`` script in the second LFRic example:

.. code-block:: console

    cd <EGS_HOME>/examples/lfric/eg2
    psyclone --psykal-dsl lfric -d ../code -s ./print_psyir_trans.py \
        -opsy psy.f90 -oalg alg.f90 ./multi_invoke_mod.x90

Take a look at the ``print_psyir_trans.py`` script for more information. *Hint*;
you can insert a single line in that script in order to break into the Python
interpreter during execution: ``import pdb; pdb.set_trace()``. This then enables
interactive exploration of the PSyIR if you are interested.

.. TODO #2627
  Alternatively, you can play with some interactive examples
  on `Binder <https://github.com/stfc/PSyclone#try-it-on-binder>`_.
