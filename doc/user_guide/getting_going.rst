Getting Going
=============

.. _getting-going-download:

Download
--------

The following instructions are intended for a PSyclone user who wants
to work with a released version of the code. If you are a developer or
wish to test a specific branch of PSyclone from the GitHub repository
please see :ref:`dev-installation` in the
`Developer Guide <https://psyclone-dev.readthedocs.io/>`_.

PSyclone is available on the Python Package Index
`(PyPI) <https://pypi.org/>`_ and is hosted on GitHub:

``https://github.com/stfc/PSyclone``

The latest release is |release| and the latest stable version is on
the master branch.

There are two ways to install PSyclone. The first one is directly from
PyPI using ``pip install``, see :ref:`getting-going-env-pypi` for
more detailed information.

Alternatively, PSyclone can be downloaded from GitHub - either see |release|
in the ``Tags`` `tab <https://github.com/stfc/PSyclone/tags>`_
on the PSyclone page or download and extract the latest release of
PSyclone directly, e.g.

.. parsed-literal::
   > wget \https://github.com/stfc/PSyclone/archive/\ |release|\ .tar.gz
   > tar zxf \ |release|\ .tar.gz
   > ls
   PSyclone-\ |release|\

After the source package is downloaded and unpacked, it can be installed
using ``pip install``, albeit in a slightly different way to the PyPI
installation, see :ref:`getting-going-env-src` for more detailed
information.

Hereon the location where you download or clone PSyclone (including the
PSyclone directory itself) will be referred to as ``<PSYCLONEHOME>``.

.. _getting-going-env:

Environment
-----------

In order to use PSyclone (including running the test suite and
building documentation) you will need to install it. Before starting
the installation process, please refer to the
:ref:`Dependencies <getting-going-depend>` section below.

.. _getting-going-env-pypi:

Installation from PyPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The simplest, and recommended, installation process is from
`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/PSyclone/>`_ using ``pip``::

   > pip install psyclone

for the latest available release, or::

   > pip install psyclone==X.Y.Z

where ``X.Y.Z`` is the specific PSyclone release version (e.g. |release|).

By default, ``pip`` will attempt a system-wide install. If you wish
to do a user-local install instead then supply the ``--user`` flag::

   > pip install --user psyclone

PSyclone can also be installed to a specific location using ``--install-option``
(see ``pip`` `documentation <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/>`_
for more detailed information)::

   > pip install --install-option="--prefix=/my/install/path" psyclone==X.Y.Z

Depending on the installation option (e.g. system-wide, user), PSyclone
will be installed in different :ref:`locations <getting-going-env-loc>`.

.. _getting-going-env-src:

Installation from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PSyclone can also be installed from a
:ref:`downloaded <getting-going-download>` release or repository clone. The
simplest way to do this is to use ``pip`` with the supplied ``setup.py``::

   > cd <PSYCLONEHOME>
   > pip install .

As above, this attempts a system-wide install. For a user-local install use::

   > pip install --user .

and for a specific location use::

   > pip install --install-option="--prefix=/my/install/path" .

If for some reason you would rather not use ``pip`` then you can run the
setup manually::

   > python setup.py install

or, if you do not have root access::

   > python setup.py install --user

or::

   > python setup.py install --install-option="--prefix=/my/install/path"

As for the :ref:`PyPI installation <getting-going-env-pypi>`, different
installation options lead to different
:ref:`locations <getting-going-env-loc>` of PSyclone installation.

.. _getting-going-env-loc:

Location and structure of PSyclone installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Location of installed Pyclone scripts, modules and other accompanying
resources is similar to other Python packages:

* The ``psyclone`` :ref:`script <psyclone_command>` is located
  in ``<python-base-prefix>/bin`` directory (depending on your Linux
  distribution, you may need to add this location to your ``$PATH``).

* The PSyclone Python modules are located in
  ``<python-base-prefix>/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages`` directory (where
  ``X.Y`` is the version of Python that you are using).

* The :ref:`configuration file <getting-going-configuration>`,
  :ref:`examples <examples>`, :ref:`tutorial <tutorial>` and
  :ref:`libraries <libraries>` are installed in
  ``<python-base-prefix>/share/psyclone`` directory.

For a system-wide installation on Linux, ``<python-base-prefix>`` will
likely be ``/usr`` and if a user-local installation is performed
it will likely be ``~/.local``.

For an installation to a specific location, ``<python-base-prefix>``
is simply the path given to the
``--install-option="--prefix=/my/install/path"``. Note that if using
this method, it will be necessary to take further action to ensure
PSyclone can find the :ref:`configuration file <getting-going-configuration>`
installed as a part of this process.

.. _getting-going-env-win:

Windows environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PSyclone can also be installed in `Python Windows environment
<https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`_ using ``pip`` as described
above. There are some differences in directory structure from Linux,
for instance the script directory is usually called ``Scripts`` instead
of ``bin`` and the modules directory ``Lib`` instead of ``lib``.

Installation in an `Anaconda Python
<https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution>`_ environment on
Windows also needs to be done using ``pip`` as ``conda install`` for
PSyclone is currently not supported.

.. _getting-going-depend:

Dependencies
------------

PSyclone is written in Python so needs Python 3 to be installed on the
target machine. PSyclone is regularly tested with Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.12
but should work with any version >= 3.6. (The last PSyclone release to
support Python 2.7 was version 2.1.0.)

PSyclone immediately relies on four external Python packages; ``configparser``,
``fparser``, ``sympy``, and ``pyparsing``. The easiest way to satisfy the
Python dependencies is to use the
`PyPI installation <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/>`_
and ``pip``.

If everything is working correctly then using ``pip`` to install PSyclone::

   > pip install psyclone

will automatically install the Python dependencies.

.. warning:: Starting with the release 1.6.1, PSyclone will install a
             specific release of ``fparser`` (version specified in the
             ``setup.py`` script).

In addition to the mandatory dependencies just described, PSyclone
also has optional dependencies on both ``graphviz`` and ``termcolor``.
PSyclone can use ``graphviz`` to produce a visualisation of a schedule's
dependency graph. If this is desired then the Python package
``graphviz`` (for the Python bindings) as well as the ``graphviz`` package
itself must be installed. If the ``graphviz`` package is not available
then the associated PSyclone routines will return silently and no
visualisations will be produced. The Python package ``termcolor`` is
used for pretty-printing a schedule in terminals that support coloured
text. If the package is not available then the schedule is simply
printed in plain text without colour highlighting.


System-specific set-up
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`system_specific_setup` instructions are available for Ubuntu 14.04.2 and
OpenSUSE 42.2.

fparser
^^^^^^^

The ``fparser`` package (https://github.com/stfc/fparser) is a Fortran
parser originally developed as a part of the `f2py project
<http://www.f2py.com/>`_.

``fparser`` is available from the Python Package
Index and thus may be installed using ``pip``
(https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#requirements-for-installing-packages):
::

   > pip install fparser

If you do not have sufficient permissions to perform a system-wide install
then you can instruct ``pip`` to do a user-local install:
::

   > pip install --user fparser

Should you wish to remove ``fparser`` then simply do:
::

   > pip uninstall fparser

If you have already installed ``fparser`` and want to upgrade to the
latest version simply do:
::

   > pip install fparser --upgrade


.. warning:: Due to the above-mentioned reliance of PSyclone on a specific
             ``fparser`` release, it is not advisable to install ``fparser``
             independently unless it is not to be used with PSyclone. An
             exception is installation of PSyclone from source for
             development purposes, see :ref:`dev-installation` in the
             `Developer Guide <https://psyclone-dev.readthedocs.io/>`_.

pyparsing
^^^^^^^^^

PSyclone requires ``pyparsing``, a library designed to allow parsers to
be built in Python. PSyclone uses ``pyparsing`` to parse Fortran regular
expressions as ``fparser`` does not fully parse these (see
`here <https://github.com/pyparsing>`__ for more information).

PSyclone has been tested with ``pyparsing`` versions 1.5.2, 2.0.1 and 2.2.0.

You can test whether ``pyparsing`` is already installed on your machine by
typing ``import pyparsing`` from the Python command line. If ``pyparsing``
is installed, this command will complete successfully. If ``pyparsing`` is
installed you can check its version by typing
``pyparsing.__version__`` after successfully importing it.

If ``pyparsing`` is not installed on your system then it may be installed
from the Python Package Index using ``pip``:
::

   > pip install pyparsing

Should you wish to, uninstalling is simply performed by doing:
::

   > pip uninstall pyparsing

If you do not have sufficient privileges for a system-wide install then
you can instruct ``pip`` to do a user-local install:
::

   > pip install --user pyparsing

Alternatively, you could follow `these instructions
<https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing>`_.


SymPy
^^^^^

PSyclone requires ``sympy``, a library for symbolic mathematics. PSyclone
uses ``sympy`` to reason about expression being equal or not, e.g. ``i+j``
and ``j+i``. PSyclone has been tested with ``sympy`` versions 1.7.1.

You can test whether ``sympy`` is already installed on your machine by
typing ``import sympy`` from the Python command line. If ``sympy``
is installed, this command will complete successfully. If ``sympy`` is
installed you can check its version by typing
``sympy.__version__`` after successfully importing it.

If ``sympy`` is not installed on your system then it may be installed
from the Python Package Index using ``pip``:
::

   > pip install sympy

Should you wish to, uninstalling is simply performed by doing:
::

   > pip uninstall sympy

If you do not have sufficient privileges for a system-wide install then
you can instruct ``pip`` to do a user-local install:
::

   > pip install --user sympy

Alternatively, you could follow the instructions on the `SymPy web page
<https://docs.sympy.org/latest/install.html>`_.

Graphviz
^^^^^^^^

The data dependencies of a PSyIR schedule determine the validity of
changes to this schedule.
PSyclone supports the visualisation of these dependencies as
a graph using ``graphviz``. This visualisation is not needed to use
PSyclone.

If the Python bindings to ``graphviz`` are not installed on your system
then it may be installed from the Python Package Index using ``pip``:
::

   > sudo pip install graphviz

Should you wish to, uninstalling is simply performed by doing:
::

   > sudo pip uninstall graphviz

If you do not have sufficient privileges for a system-wide install then
you can instruct ``pip`` to do a user-local install:
::

   > pip install --user graphviz

If ``graphviz`` itself is not installed on your system and your system
supports the ``apt`` package manager then see below, otherwise please
refer to the download and install instructions which are available
`here <https://graphviz.org/download/>`__.

If your system supports the ``apt`` package manager then it can be
installed and removed in the following way:
::

   > sudo apt install graphviz
   > sudo apt remove graphviz

termcolor
^^^^^^^^^

By default, the ``view()`` method available on any PSyIR (PSyclone
Internal Representation) object prints a plain-text representation
to standard-out. However, if the ``termcolor`` package is available
then PSyclone uses this to add colour highlighting to the output text.

Installation (and uninstallation) of this package can be done via
``pip`` in exactly the same way as for ``graphviz``, as described above.

.. _getting-going-configuration:

Configuration
-------------

Various aspects of PSyclone are configured through a configuration
file, ``psyclone.cfg``. The default version of this file is installed
to ``<python-base-prefix>/shared/psyclone/`` during the installation
process. Similar to what is described :ref:`above
<getting-going-env-loc>`, if a system-wide installation is being
performed then this will likely be ``/usr/share/psyclone/``.
If a user-local installation is performed (``--user`` flag to
``pip install``) then the location will be something like
``~/.local/share/psyclone/``.

.. warning::

   If PSyclone is installed to a non-standard location (e.g. by specifying
   the ``--install-option="--prefix=...`` option to ``pip install``) then
   PSyclone will not be able to find the configuration file at execution
   time. There are two solutions to this: 1. copy the configuration file to
   a location where PSyclone will find it (see :ref:`configuration`) or
   2. set the ``PSYCLONE_CONFIG`` environment variable to the full-path to
   the configuration file, e.g.::

   > export PSYCLONE_CONFIG=/some/path/PSyclone/config/psyclone.cfg

.. warning::

   When installing in 'editable' mode (``-e`` flag to ``pip``), ``pip``
   does *not* install the configuration file. You will have to take one
   of the two actions described above.

See :ref:`configuration` for details of the settings contained within
the config file.

Test
----

PSyclone contains an extensive test suite, but this test suite is not
part of a standard installation. If you want to run the full test 
suite, you need to install PSyclone from source, see :ref:`above
<getting-going-env-src>` or  :ref:`dev-installation` in the
`Developer Guide <https://psyclone-dev.readthedocs.io/>`_.

.. _getting-going-run:

Run
---

You are now ready to try running PSyclone on the :ref:`examples <examples>`.
One way of doing this is to use the ``psyclone`` driver script. Assuming it
is on your ``PATH``::

   > psyclone
   usage: psyclone [-h] [-oalg OALG] [-opsy OPSY] [-okern OKERN] [-api API]
                   [-s SCRIPT] [-d DIRECTORY] [-I INCLUDE] [-l {off,all,output}]
                   [-dm] [-nodm] [--kernel-renaming {multiple,single}]
                   [--profile {invokes,kernels}] [--config CONFIG] [--version]
                   filename
   psyclone: error: the following arguments are required: filename

As indicated above, the ``psyclone`` script takes the name of the
Fortran source file containing the algorithm specification (in terms
of calls to ``invoke()``). It parses this, finds the necessary kernel
source files and produces two Fortran files. The first contains the
:ref:`PSy, middle layer <PSy-layer>` and the second a re-write of the
:ref:`algorithm code <algorithm-layer>` to use that layer. These files
are named according to the user-supplied arguments (options ``-oalg``
and ``-opsy``). If those arguments are not supplied then the script writes
the generated/re-written Fortran to the terminal. For details of the other
command-line arguments please see the :ref:`psyclone_command` Section.

Examples are provided in the ``examples`` directory of the PSyclone Git
repository - if you have cloned the repository then ``EGS_HOME`` in
what follows is the root ``PSyclone`` directory. Alternatively, if you
have installed PSyclone using ``pip`` then they may be found in the
``share/psyclone`` directory under your Python installation (see
:ref:`above <getting-going-env-loc>` for location of PSyclone installation.
In this case you should copy the whole ``examples`` directory to some
convenient location (hereafter called ``EGS_HOME``) before attempting to
carry out the following instructions. Depending on your precise setup, you
may also need to set ``PSYCLONE_CONFIG`` to the full-path to the PSyclone
configuration file (see :ref:`getting-going-configuration`).

There are seven subdirectories, three of which (``lfric``, ``gocean``
and ``nemo``) correspond to the different APIs/domains that are
supported by PSyclone. (Note, that we are currently in the process of
renaming the ``dynamo0.3`` API to ``lfric``.)  In this case we are
going to use one of the LFRic examples::

   > cd <EGS_HOME>/examples/lfric/eg1
   > psyclone -api dynamo0.3 -d ../code -nodm -oalg alg.f90 \
       -opsy psy.f90 ./single_invoke.x90


You should see two new files created, called ``alg.f90`` (containing
the re-written algorithm layer) and ``psy.f90`` (containing the
generated PSy- or middle-layer). Since this is an LFRic example the
Fortran source code has dependencies on the LFRic system and
therefore cannot be compiled stand-alone.

The PSy-layer that PSyclone creates is constructed using the PSyclone Internal
Representation (:ref:`PSyIR <psyir-ug>`). Accessing this is demonstrated
by the ``print_psyir_trans.py`` script in the second LFRic example::

  > cd <EGS_HOME>/examples/lfric/eg2
  > psyclone -api dynamo0.3 -d ../code -s ./print_psyir_trans.py \
      -opsy psy.f90 -oalg alg.f90 ./multi_invoke_mod.x90

Take a look at the ``print_psyir_trans.py`` script for more information. *Hint*;
you can insert a single line in that script in order to break into the Python
interpreter during execution: ``import pdb; pdb.set_trace()``. This then enables
interactive exploration of the PSyIR if you are interested. Alternatively,
you can play with some interactive examples on `Binder <https://github.com/stfc/PSyclone#try-it-on-binder>`_.
