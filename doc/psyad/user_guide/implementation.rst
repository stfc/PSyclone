Implementation
==============

The approach taken is the line-by-line method, where the order of
computation is reversed and each line of the tangent-linear code is
transformed into its adjoint form.

This approach is implemented in PSyclone by parsing the tangent-linear
code and transforming it into the PSyIR (the PSyclone Internal
Representation). Transformations have been written that tranform the
PSyIR representation into its adjoint form. These transformations are
then applied to the PSyIR representation. Once this is complete, the PSyIR
representation is then written back out as code.


Active variables
++++++++++++++++

When creating the adjoint of a tangent-linear code the active
variables must be specified. The remaining variables are inactive (or
trajectory) variables. The active variables are the ones that are
transformed and reversed, whereas the inactive (trajectory) variables
remain unchanged.

.. Note:: it should be possisble to only need to specify global
	  variables (ones with a lifetime beyond the code i.e. passed
	  in via argument, modules etc.) as local variables will
	  inherit being active or inactive based on how they are
	  used. However, this logic has not yet been implemented so at
	  the moment all variables (local and global) must be
	  specified.

Statements
++++++++++

As the line-by-line method is used then there are rules that must be
followed for the different types of statements. This section goes
through the rules for each supported statement type.

Assignments
-----------

If a tangent-linear assigment statement contains no active variables
then it is left unchanged when creating the adjoint code.

If a tangent-linear assignment statement contains one or more active
variables then it must be in the following general form:

.. math::

   A = xA + \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} y_i B_i

where :math:`A` and :math:`B_i` are active variables, :math:`x` and
:math:`y_i` are expressions that do not contain any active variables
and there is no limit on the size of :math:`N`.

If this is not the case the associated PSyclone transformation will
raise an exception, which will be reported to the user as an error
when running the psyad script.

For illustration, consider the case where there are 3 active variables
(equivalent to :math:`N=2`). We can then write this case in the
following form:

.. math::

    A = xA + yB + zC

where :math:`A`, :math:`B` and :math:`C` are active variables and
:math:`x`, :math:`y` and :math:`z` are expressions that do not contain
active variables.

If the above example is shown in matrix form, we have:

.. math::

    \begin{bmatrix} A \\ B \\ C \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x & y & z \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} * \begin{bmatrix} A \\ B \\ C \end{bmatrix}

The adjoint of the assignment is obtained by transposing the matrix:

.. math::

    \begin{bmatrix} \hat{A} \\ \hat{B} \\ \hat{C} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x & 0 & 0 \\ y & 1 & 0 \\ z & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} * \begin{bmatrix} \hat{A} \\ \hat{B} \\ \hat{C} \end{bmatrix}

where :math:`\hat{A}` denotes the adjoint of the original active variable :math:`A`. This gives the
following adjoint assignments:

.. math::

    \hat{C} = \hat{C} + z\hat{A} \\
    \hat{B} = \hat{B} + y\hat{A} \\
    \hat{A} = x\hat{A}

Notice that if the expression :math:`x` is :math:`0` then the
tangent-linear code writes to :math:`\hat{A}`, rather than updating it
i.e.:

.. math::

    A = 0.A + yB + yC

which is:

.. math::

    A = yB + zC

and its adjoint will set :math:`\hat{A}` to zero:

.. math::

    \hat{C} = \hat{C} + z\hat{A} \\
    \hat{B} = \hat{B} + y\hat{A} \\
    \hat{A} = 0

Finally, notice that if :math:`x=y=z=0` then the original
tangent-linear code sets :math:`A` to zero:

.. math::

    A = 0.A + 0.B + 0.C

which is:

.. math::

    A = 0

and its adjoint sets :math:`\hat{A}` to zero

.. math::

    \hat{A} = 0

.. note:: in all cases :math:`\hat{A}` should be written to after it has been
          read.

Rules
*****

Rather than creating a matrix and transposing it, it can be seen that
there are some relatively simple rules that can be followed in order
to create the adjoint of a tangent-linear assignment. This is how the
PSyAD `AssigmentTrans` transformation is implemented. Let's look
again at the previous example tangent-linear statement:

.. math::

    A = xA + yB + zC

If each of the terms on the right-hand-side (RHS) of the statement are taken in turn
(i.e. :math:`xA`, then :math:`yB`, then :math:`xC`) there are two cases to consider:

1) the active variable in the RHS term is different to the active
   variable on the left-hand-side (LHS) of the assigment.
2) the active variable in the RHS term is the same as the active
   variable on the LHS of the assigment.

In case 1, the adjoint is simply the active variable on the RHS being
updated with the product of its multiplier in the tangent-linear
expression with the left-hand active variable. For example, take the
case:

.. math::

    A = ... yB ...

the adjoint for this term is:

.. math::

    \hat{B} = \hat{B} + y\hat{A}

In case 2, the adjoint is simply the active variable being multiplied
by the associated term. For the case:

.. math::

    A = xA ...

the adjoint for this term is:

.. math::

    \hat{A} = x\hat{A}

If there is no term for :math:`A` on the RHS of the assignment then the
adjoint variable :math:`\hat{A}` must be set to zero:

.. math::

    \hat{A} = 0

Array accesses
**************

Active variables will typically be arrays that are accessed within a
loop. These can usually be treated in the same way as the scalars
illustrated above.

However, in the case of stencils, accesses to different parts of an
array in the same statement should be treated as if they were a
different variable. For example:

.. math::

    A(i) = xA(i) + yA(i-1)

would become:

.. math::

    \hat{A}(i-1) = \hat{A}(i-1) + y\hat{A}(i) \\
    \hat{A}(i) = x\hat{A}(i)

.. warning:: The authors are not sure that this code is actually
   correct and it needs to be checked. It might be that all iterations
   of the first adjoint assignment should be performed before all
   iterations of the second (i.e. in separate loops).

In LFRic, a kernel is forbidden from writing to data outside the
current column (e.g. to element :math:`i-1`) and therefore appropriate
transformations will need to be applied to restructure the code.

Limitations
***********

If an active variable is part of the denominator in a division then
the transformation will always raise an exception stating that this
assignment is in an invalid tangent-linear form. For example
:math:`A=x/B` where :math:`A` and :math:`B` are active
variables. However, if the active variable is within an even number of
divides then it is is, in fact, valid and should not result in an
exception. For example :math:`A=x(/y/B)` is equivalent to
:math:`A=(x/y)B`. Issue #1348 captures this current limitation.
