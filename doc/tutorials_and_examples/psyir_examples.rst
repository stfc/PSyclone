Example 1: Constructing PSyIR and Generating Code
-------------------------------------------------

``create.py`` is a Python script that demonstrates the use of the various
``create`` methods to build a PSyIR tree from scratch.

Example 2: Creating PSyIR for Structure Types
---------------------------------------------

``create_structure_types.py`` demonstrates the representation of
structure types (i.e. Fortran derived types or C structs) in the PSyIR.
