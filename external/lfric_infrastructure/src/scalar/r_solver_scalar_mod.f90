module r_solver_scalar_mod

  ! Eventually the precision of scalar data for use in the solver will be set
  ! in a module held within the model (as it is model information). For now,
  ! PSyclone is expecting to "use" the definitions from here, so this is where
  ! it is set
  use scalar_real64_mod, only: r_solver_scalar_type => scalar_real64_type

  implicit none
  private

  public :: r_solver_scalar_type

end module r_solver_scalar_mod
