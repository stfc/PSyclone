# This Makefile is automatically created by ../update.sh
# ======================================================

# Don't modify the file directly, if required, update ../update.sh
# to update the Makefile.

# This Makefile only delegates the target to the parent's Makefile.
# This way the main Makefile can be shared among different pre-processed
# directories (if required), and is easily visible in git.
