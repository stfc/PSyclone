# This makefiles finds all subdirectories of $(LFRIC_PATH) and adds
# include directives for each of these paths to F90FLAGS. For example.
# if the directories of $(LFRIC_PATH) are `field` and `mesh`, it would add:
# -I $(LFRIC_PATH)/field -I $(LFRIC_PATH)/mesh
# This makefile is included from the makefile that builds the LFRic
# infrastructure files of PSyclone, but can also be used by any other
# Makefile that needs the LFRic infrastructure (e.g. in the examples or
# PSyData wrapper libraries).
#
# The following variables are defined:
# DIRS: all subdirectories under $(LFRIC_PATH).
# LFRIC_INCLUDE_FLAGS: the required include flags to compile using the
#     LFRic infrastructure files.

# If this file is used to determine the flags of an already compiled
# version of the infrastructure library, the include path must use
# $(LFRIC_PATH), which is the location of the compiled LFRic
# infrastructure files.
# But if this file is used to compile the infrastructure library
# $(LFRIC_PATH) is actually the location of the source files and not
# the build directory. So in this case the calling Makefile has to
# define $(BUILD_PATH) to point to the build directory.

BUILD_PATH ?= $(LFRIC_PATH)
DIRS := $(subst $(LFRIC_PATH),,\
		    $(shell find $(LFRIC_PATH) -type d -print))
LFRIC_INCLUDE_FLAGS ?= $(patsubst %,-I $(BUILD_PATH)/%,$(DIRS))
