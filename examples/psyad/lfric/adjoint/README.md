This directory contains fully working adjoint kernels. At the moment
all kernels generated by `psyad` require manual tweaks so the kernels
in this directory have been manually modified and are kept in the
repository. In the future, any kernels that `psyad` is able to
generate without needing any tweaks will be created here and a copy of
the adjoint kernel will no longer be kept in the repository.

Manual tweaks are performed by first generating the adjoint code `cd
..;make` and then the relevant adjoint kernel is copied from the
`adjoint_partial` directory and is updated manually in an editor.

The tweaks made to the adjoint kernel code can be easily seen using
`diff`. For example, after creating the adjoint code (`cd ..;make`),
run `diff adj_matrix_vector_kernel_mod.F90
../adjoint_tweaked/adj_matrix_vector_kernel_mod.F90`
