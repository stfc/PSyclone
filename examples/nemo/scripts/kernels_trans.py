'''A transformation script that seeks to apply OpenACC DATA and KERNELS
directives to NEMO style code. In order to use it you must first install
PSyclone. See README.md in the top-level directory.

Once you have psyclone installed, this may be used by doing:

 $ psyclone -api nemo -s kernels_trans.py some_source_file.f90

This should produce a lot of output, ending with generated
Fortran. Note that the Fortran source files provided to PSyclone must
have already been preprocessed (if required).

The transformation script attempts to insert Kernels directives at the
highest possible location(s) in the schedule tree (i.e. to enclose as
much code as possible in each Kernels region). However, due to
limitations in the Nvidia compiler, we must take care to exclude certain
nodes (such as If blocks) from within Kernel regions. If a proposed
region is found to contain such a node (by the ``valid_acc_kernel``
routine) then the script moves a level down the tree and then repeats
the process of attempting to create the largest possible Kernel region.

Tested with the NVIDIA HPC SDK version 23.7.
