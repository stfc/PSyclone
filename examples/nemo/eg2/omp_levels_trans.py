'''A simple transformation script for the introduction of OpenMP with PSyclone.
In order to use it you must first install PSyclone. See README.md in the
top-level psyclone directory.

Once you have PSyclone installed, this script may be used by doing:

 >>> psyclone -s ./omp_levels_trans.py traldf_iso.F90

This should produce a lot of output, ending with generated
Fortran.

# Set up some loop_type inference rules in order to reference useful domain
# loop constructs by name
