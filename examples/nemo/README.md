# PSyclone NEMO Examples

This directory contains various examples of the use of PSyclone
to transform source code from the NEMO ocean model. See the READMEs
in the individual example directories for further details.

## Code

Contains:

1. the Tracer advection benchmark routine (tra_adv), as provided by
   Silvia Mocavero of CMCC and
2. an unmodified NEMO subroutine computing the horizontal component of
   the lateral tracer mixing trend (traldf_iso).

## Scripts

Contains two scripts used to process the NEMO code base and to add profiling
instrumentation (https://psyclone.readthedocs.io/en/stable/profiling.html)
and OpenACC directives:

1. `process_nemo.py` is a driver script that allows the user to specify
   which files to process with PSyclone, the transformation script to use
   and where to put the outputs:

       $ ./process_nemo.py -h
       usage: process_nemo.py [-h] [-o OUT_DIR] [-s SCRIPT_FILE] [-x]
                              input_file [input_file ...]

       Process the specified NEMO source files using PSyclone

       positional arguments:
         input_file      One or more NEMO pre-processed source files

       optional arguments:
         -h, --help      show this help message and exit
         -o OUT_DIR      Destination directory for processed source files
         -s SCRIPT_FILE  PSyclone transformation script
         -x              exit immediately if PSyclone fails

   In addition to the command-line flags, the script itself contains two
   variables that may be used to control its behaviour:

   - `EXCLUDED_FILES`: list of filenames that will not have OpenACC directives
     added.
   - `PROFILE_ALL`: whether or not to add profiling instrumentation to every
     file, irrespective of whether the file is listed in `EXCLUDED_FILES`.

   Finally, the precise invocation to use when running PSyclone may be
   specified by setting the `PSYCLONE` environment variable. If this is not set
   then `psyclone` must be in the user's PATH.

2. `kernels_trans.py` is a PSyclone transformation script that adds
   OpenACC directives and places fine-grained profiling instrumentation around
   any regions that haven't had OpenACC added.

## Example 1

OpenMP parallelisation of tra_adv over levels.

## Example 2

OpenMP parallelisation of traldf_iso over levels.

## Example 3

OpenACC parallelisation of tra_adv. Contains a local transformation
script that adds both 'data' and 'kernels' directives to the
code. Also demonstrates the use of the `kernels_trans.py` script from
the `scripts` directory which adds 'kernels' and 'loop' directives as
well as profiling instrumentation. This script is designed for use
with NVIDIA's managed memory technology and therefore does not insert
data regions.

## Example 4

SIR generation and transformation to CUDA using Dawn with simple
examples and a cut down version of the tracer advection (tra_adv)
benchmark.
