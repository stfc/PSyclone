'''Module providing a transformation script that converts the supplied
PSyIR to the Stencil intermediate representation (SIR). Translation to
the SIR is limited to the NEMO API. The NEMO API has no algorithm
layer so all of the original code is captured in the invoke
objects. Therefore by translating all of the invoke objects, all of
the original code is translated.
