'''Module providing a transformation script that converts the supplied
PSyIR to the Stencil intermediate representation (SIR) and

1) modifies any PSyIR min, max, abs and sign intrinsics to PSyIR code
beforehand using transformations, as SIR does not support intrinsics.

2) transforms implicit loops to explicit loops as the SIR does not
have the concept of implicit loops.

Translation to the SIR is limited to the NEMO API. The NEMO API has no
algorithm layer so all of the original code is captured in the invoke
objects. Therefore by translating all of the invoke objects, all of
the original code is translated.
