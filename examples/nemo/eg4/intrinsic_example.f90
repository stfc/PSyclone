! Code extracted from the tra_adv benchmark making use of intrinsics
! MIN, ABS and SIGN. Literals have had the Fortran double precision
! specification (e.g. 1.d0) removed. This code is provided purely to
! demonstrate the removal of intrinsics via PSyclone transformations,
! it is not designed to be run.
