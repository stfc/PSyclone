!> This is a simple test program that creates a small
!! dl_esm_inf grid, then declares 4 fields on that grid
!! and calls some trivial kernels to do some work.

Program test
    USE field_mod
    USE grid_mod
    use decomposition_mod, only : decomposition_type
    use parallel_mod, only      : parallel_init

    use init_field_mod,   only : init_field
    use update_field_mod, only : update_field
    use nan_test_psy_data_mod, only: nan_test_PSyDataInit, &
        nan_test_PSyDataShutdown, nan_test_PSyDataStart

    TYPE(r2d_field)          :: a_fld, b_fld
    TYPE(grid_type), target  :: grid

    ! Initialise dl_esm_inf and create a grid:
    call parallel_init()
    call nan_test_PSyDataInit()
    ! Just to show how to use the start function. It is not
    ! actually required, since the previous call enables it anyway.
    call nan_test_PSyDataStart()
    grid = grid_type(GO_ARAKAWA_C,                                 &
                     (/GO_BC_PERIODIC,GO_BC_PERIODIC,GO_BC_NONE/), &
                     GO_OFFSET_SW)
    ! Create a grid with 3x3 points, decomposed into 
    ! 1 domain as 1x1. Define a halo of width 1
    call grid%decompose(3, 3, 1, 1, 1, halo_width=1)
    call grid_init(grid, 1.0_8, 1.0_8)

    ! Declare the fields on this grid:
    a_fld = r2d_field(grid, GO_T_POINTS)
    b_fld = r2d_field(grid, GO_T_POINTS)

    ! Use a kernel to initialise each field:
    call invoke (init_field(a_fld, 1.0), &
                 init_field(b_Fld, 2.0)    )


    ! Use a kernel to do some simple maths. But this kernel
    ! will execute some division by zero, creating NANs in
    ! the output field `a_fld`.
    call invoke (update_field(a_fld, b_fld) )
    print *,"a_fld is", a_fld%data
    call nan_test_PSyDataShutdown()

end program test
