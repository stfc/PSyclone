# PSyclone GOcean PSyData NaN-check Example

**Author:** J. Henrichs, Bureau of Meteorology

## Introduction

This is a simple example that shows how to use the NaN verification
support in PSyclone. It is a stand-alone program that can be compiled
and run. 

## Compilation
A makefile is provided to compile this example. If required,
it will compile the dl_esm_inf library and the nan_test
wrapper library. By default, the compilation uses the version
of the dl_esm_inf library provided as a git submodule (under
``../../../external/dl_esm_inf/finite_difference``- see
https://psyclone-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/working_practises.html)
within the PSyclone repository. You can set the environment variable
``INF_DIR`` for the ``make`` command to pick a different version.

The makefile here invokes psyclone with the script ``test_nan_transform.py``.
This script uses PSyclone's ``NanTestTrans`` to instrument the two
invokes in the ``test.x90`` source file.

The source code computes divisions by 0 on the diagonals, resulting in
invalid numbers (Infinity).

## Running
```
$ ./nan_test
...
Allocating C-T field with bounds: (1:   6,1:   6), internal region is (2:   4,2:   4)
PSyData: Variable a_fld has the invalid value Inf at index/indices 1 1 in module 'main' region 'update'.
PSyData: Variable a_fld has the invalid value Inf at index/indices 2 2 in module 'main' region 'update'.

```
After calling the kernel ``mainupdate``, five warnings are printed,
indicating that the field ``a_fld`` has a value of infinity on the diagonals
(i.e. indices 1 1, ..., 5 5).
