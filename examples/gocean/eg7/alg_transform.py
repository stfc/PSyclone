'''Python script intended to be passed to the 'psyclone' command
via its -s option. This script demonstrates the use of the
optional trans_alg() function which gives access to PSyclone's
internal representation of the algorithm layer.

'''
from psyclone.domain.common.algorithm.psyir import AlgorithmInvokeCall


def trans(psy):
    '''The trans function is required for the script to be valid.'''
    return psy


def trans_alg(psyir):
    '''Output algorithm layer invoke information.'''
    for invoke in psyir.walk(AlgorithmInvokeCall):
        print(invoke.view())
