'''A simple Python script showing how to create and manipulate
aggregate types within the PSyIR. In order to use it you must first install
PSyclone. See README.md in the top-level psyclone directory.

Once you have psyclone installed, this script may be run by doing:

>>> python create_aggregate_types.py

TODO #363 Ultimately this will output a Fortran representation of the PSyIR but
this is a work in progress.
