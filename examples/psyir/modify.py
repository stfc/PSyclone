'''A simple Python script showing how to modify a PSyIR tree. In order to use
it you must first install PSyclone. See README.md in the top-level psyclone
directory.

Once you have psyclone installed, this script may be run by doing:

>>> python modify.py

This will first create a tree as specified in the create.py file and
then proceed to modify the tree and generate the modified code Fortran
representation.

    # may have references, which could then lead to inconsistencies. Therefore
    # we support the specialise method, which transforms the existing
    # node type to a subclass of type without changing the memory
    # location of the instance. Note, any additional subclass properties would
    # have to be added manually.
