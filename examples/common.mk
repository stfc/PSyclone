# Defines rules and variables used in all of the Makefiles within the
# directory tree of examples.

# Make sure we use the configuration file distributed with PSyclone
# instead of any locally-installed version.
#
# **Note** that this code to find the correct directory only works if
#          the examples directory is still within the standard PSyclone
#          source tree. If it has been moved then the PSYCLONE_CONFIG
#          environment variable will have to be set to the full path
#          to the config file before make is launched.

# MAKEFILE_LIST is a Gnu-make variable that contains all of the
# arguments passed to the first invocation of Make. The last entry
# in this list is the current file.
