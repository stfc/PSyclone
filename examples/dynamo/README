The dynamo examples in the eg1 and eg2 directories below the one
containing this README use the Dynamo 0.1 API. Those in eg3 - eg7 use
version 0.3 of the Dynamo API. They are primarily provided to
illustrate the use of the PSyclone code-generation system. No guarantee
is made as to their functional correctness or usefulness (i.e. the
calculations that they perform may often be nonsensical - it is the use
of PSyclone that is being illustrated).

In order to use PSyclone you must first add it to your PYTHONPATH. The
simplest way to do this is to change to the top-level directory of your
PSyclone installation and do:
::
    export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/src:${PYTHONPATH}

PSyclone can be run for the first two examples by entering the directory and 
executing, e.g.
::
    python ./runme.py

Examine the runme*.py scripts themselves for further details.

The third example can be used to demonstrate PSyclone

1) generating distributed memory parallel code
::
    cd eg3/
    python ../../../src/generator.py solver_mod.x90
    # look for %set_dirty and %halo_exchange in the generated code

2) using a transformation script to perform loop colouring and OpenMP
parallelisation, either with distributed memory parallel code:
::
    cd eg3/
    python ../../../src/generator.py -s ./colouring_and_omp.py solver_mod.x90

or without distributed memory parallel code:
::
    cd eg3/
    python ../../../src/generator.py -s ./colouring_and_omp.py -nodm solver_mod.x90

The fourth example illustrates the use of (multiple) calls to built-in
operations within an invoke as well as the use of the name="..." argument.
It also includes the use of the enforce_bc_kernel_type kernel to apply
boundary conditions.
::
    cd eg4/
    python ../../../src/generator.py solver_mod.x90

The fifth example illustrates the use of stencils in kernels and the associated
passing of extent and direction information (where appropriate) from the
algorithm layer.
::
    cd eg5/
    python ../../../src/generator.py alg.f90

The sixth example illustrates the use and implementation of
reductions. It also demonstrates the generation of a schedule's
dependence graph in svg format (see dag.svg). Note, that if graphviz
and its Python bindings are not installed then no dag image will be
generated and the dag method will silently return. The example may be
run sequentially:
::
    cd eg6/ python
    python ../../../src/generator.py -nodm alg.x90

code parallelised with MPI:
::
    cd eg6/
    python ../../../src/generator.py alg.x90

code parallelised with OpenMP (and loop fused)
::
    cd eg6/
    python ../../../src/generator.py -nodm -s ./omp_script.py alg.x90

or code parallelised with both MPI and OpenMP (and loop fused)
::
    cd eg6/
    python ../../../src/generator.py -s ./omp_script.py alg.x90

By default the OpenMP implementations make use of the OpenMP reduction
support. OpenMP reductions do not guarantee the same results from one
run to the next for runs with the same number of OpenMP
threads. Therefore a "reprod" option has been added to the OpenMP do
loop transformation which implements a manual reduction that provides
the same results from one run to the next when using the same number
of threads
::
    cd eg6/
    python ../../../src/generator.py -s ./omp_reprod_script.py alg.x90

The seventh example illustrates the use of PSyclone with kernels that
perform operations with column-wise (Column-Matrix Assembly) operators:
::
    cd eg7/
    python ../../../src/generator.py alg.x90
