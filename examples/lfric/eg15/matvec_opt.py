'''An example PSyclone transformation script to demonstrate
optimisations to the matrix vector kernel to improve its performance
on CPUs.

The matrix vector kernel has been hand optimised for CPUs. This script
will automate these optimisations.

Optimising matvec in PSyclone is work in progress. At the moment the
only automated optimisations possible are the replacement of the
matmul intrinsic with inline code and the kernel constant
transformation (see eg13). The latter transformation does little to
matvec as it stands so the only optimisation included in this script
is the former transformation.

Below is a list of things that will be implemented to improve
performance but are not yet supported as transformations in PSyclone.

1) loop fuse gather and matmul loop
2) move indexing lookup before scatter loop
3) loop fuse scatter loop and matmul loop
4) remove scatter and gather
5) interchange k loop to make it inner
6) re-order data-layout for matrix
7) replicate kernel to support specific function spaces (psy-layer
   optimisation)
8) add kernel constants for nlayers, ndf2, ndf1 (existing transformation)

This script can be applied via the '-s' option when running PSyclone:

$ psyclone -s ./matvec_opt.py \
../code/gw_mixed_schur_preconditioner_alg_mod.x90 \
-oalg /dev/null -opsy /dev/null
