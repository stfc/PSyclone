'''A PSyclone transformation script which performs redundant
computation to remove halo exchanges where possible and then moves the
remaining ones to the beginning of the loop thereby separating the
computation from the communication. The science code for which this
example script has been written is taken from the Met Office
repository but an operator has been replaced with a field in one of
the kernels to allow redundant computation'''


def trans(psy):
    '''removes the grad_p halo exchanges by redundant computation then
    moves the remaining halo exchanges to the beginning of the invoke
    call'''
    from psyclone.transformations import Dynamo0p3RedundantComputationTrans, \
