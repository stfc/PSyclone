    PSyclone transformation routine. This is an example which performs loop
    fusion for the Built-in 'setval_c' kernels in the first 'invoke'. For the
    sake of this example we use the 'same_space' option to tell the
    transformation that this is safe to do.

    :param psy: the PSy object that PSyclone has constructed for the \
                'invoke'(s) found in the Algorithm file.
    :type psy: :py:class:`psyclone.dynamo0p3.DynamoPSy`

    :returns: the transformed PSy object.

    # the same extent and may safely be fused. (This is not actually true
    # for this particular example but we do this for the purposes of
    # illustration.)
