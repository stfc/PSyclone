'''
Python helper script which returns the information useful for Kernel
extraction: names of one or more Invokes which contain calls to the specified
Kernel and schedules of those Invokes.

Use: '$ python <path/to/script/>find_kernel.py'

The user-specified settings can be modified in the first section:
TEST_API - PSyclone API (the example here "dynamo0.3"),
ALG_PATH - Relative path to the Algorithm file from the location
           where this script is run,
ALG_NAME - Algorithm file name to be searched for Kernel calls,
KERNEL_BASENAME - Base name of the Kernel to be searched (without the
                  "_kernel_mod" and file extension),
TRANSFORM - Switch for applying transformations to PSy layer before
           searching for the Kernel call,
TRANS_SCRIPT - Name of the transformation script which applies PSyclone
               transformations to the code. A valid script file must
               contain a 'trans' function which modifies the PSy object.

# ============= 1. User-defined settings ==================================== #
#
# Specify API
TEST_API = "dynamo0.3"
# Specify path to the Algorithm file from this script's location
ALG_PATH = "../code"
# Specify Algorithm file name
ALG_NAME = "gw_mixed_schur_preconditioner_alg_mod.x90"
# Specify the Kernel base name without the "_mod" and
# file extension
KERNEL_BASENAME = "matrix_vector_kernel"
# Specify whether to apply transformations before looking for the Kernel call
# position
TRANSFORM = False
# Specify name of the transformation script
TRANS_SCRIPT = "colouring_and_omp"

# ============= 2. Manage names, paths and transformation script imports ==== #
#
# Formulate the Kernel name as it appears in the Kernel calls
KERNEL_NAME = KERNEL_BASENAME + "_code"

# transformation script as a Python module

    except ImportError:
        print("\nOptimisation error: did not find the transformation script '"
              + TRANS_SCRIPT + "'. No transformations will be applied.")

# ============= 3. Search for the Kernel call =============================== #

# will create an instance of LFRicConstants (which would raise an exception)

# Apply transformations to the PSy object if this option is enabled and
# the transformation script was loaded successfully

# call. Create lists of Invoke names which contain the specified call.
