'''
An example of PSyclone transformation script to extract the specified
Kernel after applying PSyclone transformations to the algorithm code in
gw_mixed_schur_preconditioner_alg_mod.x90. Transformations are applied
via another transformation script which is imported as a Python module.

This script can be applied via the '-s' option when running PSyclone:

$ psyclone -nodm -s extract_kernel_with_transformations.py \
    gw_mixed_schur_preconditioner_alg_mod.x90

Please note that distributed memory is not supported for code extraction
(hence the '-nodm' option above).

The user-specified settings are:
KERNEL_NAME - Name of the Kernel to be extracted as it appears in the
              PSy layer,
INVOKE_NAME - Name of the Invoke containing the Kernel call,
NODE_POSITION - Position of the Node containing the Kernel call.

Names of Invokes and positions of Nodes containing the Kernel call can
be found using the 'find_kernel.py' script.
'''

from psyclone.domain.lfric.transformations import LFRicExtractTrans

# Specify the Kernel name as it appears in the Kernel calls
# (ending with "_code")
KERNEL_NAME = "dg_matrix_vector_kernel_code"
# Specify the name of Invoke containing the Kernel call. If the name
# does not correspond to Invoke names in the Algorithm file no Kernels
# will be extracted.
INVOKE_NAME = "invoke_2"
# Specify the position of the Node containing the Kernel call. If the
# specified Node does not contain the Kernel call nothing will be
# extracted. Please note that if the Invoke contains more than one Kernel
# call with the same name specifying a wrong position may still extract
# the Kernel call, albeit not the one planned originally.
