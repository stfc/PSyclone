'''File containing a PSyclone transformation script for the Dynamo0.3
API to apply loop fusion generically. Fusion is attempted for all
adjacent loops at the top level of a schedule. It will not fuse loops
that are lower in the schedule e.g. coloured loops. This can be
applied via the -s option in the psyclone script.
