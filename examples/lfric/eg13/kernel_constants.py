'''An example PSyclone transformation script which makes ndofs, nqp*
and nlevels constant in all LFRic kernels called from within invokes
in the supplied algorithm code. This is achieved by applying the
DynKernelConstTrans transformation.

In the case where a space is defined as "any_space" in a kernel, the
associated ndofs value will not be modified (as the actual value could
change from one call to the next).

The DynKernelConstTrans transformation is work in progress and the
current version is limited to printing out the arguments that would be
transformed and the values they would take.

This script can be applied via the '-s' option when running PSyclone:

$ psyclone -s ./kernel_constants.py \
../code/gw_mixed_schur_preconditioner_alg_mod.x90 \
-oalg alg.f90 -opsy psy.f90
