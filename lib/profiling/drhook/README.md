# PSyclone Wrapper Library for Dr Hook

This is a wrapper library that maps the [PSyclone profiling API](
https://psyclone.readthedocs.io/en/stable/profiling.html#profiling)
to the Dr Hook API.

## Dependencies

The Dr Hook library  must be installed. Note that this is currently
not available on any public repository and the prospective user needs
to contact ECMWF to obtain a copy of Dr Hook.

This profiling library uses the [PSyData API](
https://psyclone.readthedocs.io/en/stable/psy_data.html) to interface with
the application. The library is based on the [PSyData base class](
https://psyclone-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/psy_data.html#psydata-base-class),
which is included in PSyclone as a Jinja template, ``psy_data_base.jinja``.
Full documentation on using this template is provided in the PSyclone
[Developer Guide](
https://psyclone-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/psy_data.html#jinja).

The library uses the ``ProfileData`` type to store Dr Hook's handle for each
region.

## Compilation

The library is compiled with ``make`` using the provided ``Makefile``. The
environment variables ``$F90`` and ``$F90FLAGS`` can be set to point to the
[Fortran compiler](./../../README.md#compilation) and flags to use. They
default to ``gfortran`` and the empty string.

In the version tested here, 1.0.0, it appears that the installation target
in the Dr Hook distribution is broken, so the following instructions and
the default values assume that Dr Hook is compiled in a ``drhook``
subdirectory called ``build`` and not installed.

To compile the PSyclone wrapper library for Dr Hook, one of the following
two ``Makefile`` variables must be set to specify the path to the Dr Hook
installation:

- ``DRHOOK_ROOT``, the path to the Dr Hook root directory in which
  Dr Hook is compiled. It defaults to ``./../../../../drhook`` in the
  ``Makefile`` (i.e., it assumes Dr Hook is installed next to a PSyclone
  repository clone). This will set ``DRHOOK_INCLUDE`` to
  ``.../drhook/include`` and ``DRHOOK_MODULES`` to
  ``.../drhook/build/module``, so that the ``*.mod`` files created in the
  build processes are found.

- ``DRHOOK_INCLUDE`` and ``DRHOOK_MODULES``: Setting these environment
  variables explicitly will allow to flexibly point to an existing
  Dr Hook installation.

**Note**, it is not known whether a proper Dr Hook installation will
install ``include`` and ``*.mod`` files in separate directories.

For instance, compiling the wrapper library with the default compiler
flags may look something like:

```shell
DRHOOK_ROOT=<path_to_drhook> make
```

The compilation process will create the wrapper library ``libdrhook_psy.a``.

### Linking the wrapper library

In order to use the wrapper with your application, you must provide the
location of the wrapper as an ``include`` path (so that the module file is found),
and link first with the wrapper library, then the DrHook library:

In order to use the wrapper with your application, the location of this
library must be provided as an ``include`` path (so that the module file
is found), and linked first with the wrapper library, ``drhook_psy``,
and then with the Dr Hook library:

```shell
$(F90) -c  ... -I <PATH-TO-PSYCLONE>/lib/profiling/drhook somefile.f90
$(F90) -o a.out ... -L <PATH-TO-PSYCLONE>/lib/profiling/drhook -ldrhook_psy \
       -L <PATH-TO-DRHOOK> -ldrhook
```

**Note:**

- The name of the Dr Hook library might depend on the way it is compiled.

- The ``<PATH-TO-PSYCLONE>`` differs depending on whether the wrapper
  library is compiled in a clone of PSyclone repository or in a PSyclone
  [installation](./../../README.md#installation).
