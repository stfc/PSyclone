# PSyclone Wrapper Library for ``dl_timer``

This is a wrapper library that maps the [PSyclone profiling API](
https://psyclone.readthedocs.io/en/stable/profiling.html#profiling) to the
dl_timer API. This library is **thread-safe**.

## Dependencies

The library dl_timer must be installed, which can be downloaded from
https://bitbucket.org/apeg/dl_timer.

This profiling library uses the [PSyData API](
https://psyclone.readthedocs.io/en/stable/psy_data.html) to interface with
the application. The library is based on the [PSyData base class](
https://psyclone-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/psy_data.html#psydata-base-class),
which is included in PSyclone as a Jinja template, ``psy_data_base.jinja``.
Full documentation on using this template is provided in the PSyclone
[Developer Guide](
https://psyclone-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/psy_data.html#jinja).

Since the profiling API does not need access to any fields or variables,
only the static subroutines and ``PreStart`` and ``PostEnd`` are implemented,
the ``PreDeclare`` and ``ProvideVariable`` methods are not created at all.

The library uses the ``ProfileData`` type and dl_timer's
timer_register function to store the module/region name (done by the base
class) and the index used by dl_timer.

## Compilation

The library is compiled with ``make`` using the provided ``Makefile``. The
environment variables ``$F90`` and ``$F90FLAGS`` can be set to point to the
[Fortran compiler](./../../README.md#compilation) and flags to use. They
default to ``gfortran`` and the empty string.

To compile the PSyclone wrapper library for dl_timer, one of the
following two ``Makefile`` variables must be set to specify the path to
the dl_timer installation:

- ``DL_TIMER_ROOT``, the path to the ``apeg-dl_timer`` directory in which
  dl_timer is compiled. It defaults to ``./../../../../dl_timer`` in
  the ``Makefile`` (i.e., it assumes dl_timer is installed next to a
  PSyclone clone).

- ``DL_TIMER_INCLUDE``, the path to the dl_timer ``include`` directory
  (i.e. ``src`` directory). This defaults to ``$DL_TIMER_ROOT/src``.

For instance, compiling the wrapper library with the default compiler
flags may look something like:

```shell
DL_TIMER_ROOT=<path_to_dl_timer> make
```

The location of the PSyData base class Jinja template,
``psy_data_base.jinja`` is specified using the environment variable
``$PSYDATA_LIB_DIR``. It defaults to the relative path to the
top-level [``lib``](./../../) directory.

The compilation process will create the wrapper library ``libdl_timer_psy.a``.

### Linking the wrapper library

In order to use the wrapper with your application, the location of this
library must be provided as an ``include`` path (so that the module file
is found), and linked first with the wrapper library, ``dl_timer_psy``,
and then with the dl_timer library:

```shell
$(F90) -c ... -I $(PSYDATA_LIB_DIR)/profiling/dl_timer somefile.f90
$(F90) -o a.out ... -L $(PSYDATA_LIB_DIR)/profiling/dl_timer -ldl_timer_psy \
       -L PATH-TO-DLTIMER -ldltimer
```
The name of the dl_timer library will depend on the way it is compiled
(shared-memory or distributed-memory parallel).

## Output

An example output of the profiling report is below:
