# Simple Stand-alone Timer Library

This library is a simple stand-alone timer library (see the ["Profiling"](
https://psyclone.readthedocs.io/en/stable/profiling.html#profiling) section
in the PSyclone [User Guide](https://psyclone.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for
more details). It counts the number of calls for each region, and reports
minumum, maximum and average times. This library is **not thread-safe**, and
**not MPI-aware** (e.g. maximum reported is per process, not across all
processes).

## Dependencies

This stand-alone profiling library uses the [PSyData API](
https://psyclone.readthedocs.io/en/stable/psy_data.html) to interface with
the application. The library is based on the [PSyData base class](
https://psyclone-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/psy_data.html#psydata-base-class),
which is included in PSyclone as a Jinja template, ``psy_data_base.jinja``.
Full documentation on using this template is provided in the PSyclone
[Developer Guide](
https://psyclone-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/psy_data.html#jinja). The
script [``process.py``](./../../README.md#psydata-base-class) is used to
process this template.

Since the profiling API does not need access to any fields or variables,
only the static subroutines and ``PreStart`` and ``PostEnd`` are implemented;
the ``PreDeclare`` and ``ProvideVariable`` methods are not created at all.

The library uses the ``ProfileData`` type to store the module/region name
(done by the base class) and then stores timing and counting information in
this derived type.

## Compilation

The library is compiled with ``make`` using the provided ``Makefile``. The
environment variables ``$F90`` and ``$F90FLAGS`` can be set to point to the
[Fortran compiler](./../../README.md#compilation) and flags to use, e.g.

```shell
F90=gfortran F90FLAGS=-g make
```

The compiler flags default to ``gfortran`` and the empty string.

The location of the PSyData base class Jinja template,
``psy_data_base.jinja`` is specified using the environment variable
``$PSYDATA_LIB_DIR``. It defaults to the relative path to the
top-level [``lib``](./../../) directory.

The compilation process will create the wrapper library ``libsimple_timing.a``.

### Linking the wrapper library

In order to link this timer library with your application, the location of
this library must be provided as an ``include`` path (so that the module
file is found). Also, the library name, ``simple_timing``, must be specified
at link time:

```shell
$(F90) -c  -I $(PSYDATA_LIB_DIR)/profiling/simple_timing some_file.f90
$(F90) some_file.o -L $(PSYDATA_LIB_DIR)/profiling/simple_timing -lsimple_timing
```

## Output

The output is written to the command line. A sample output is below:
