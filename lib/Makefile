# This Makefile just creates the Fortran base class for the PSyData library
# from the jinja template psy_data_base.jinja. The compile functionality it
# offers is only meant for testing, each library should compile its own version
# of the base class (with therefore consistent compiler settings).

# ----------- Default "make" values, can be overwritten by the user -----------
# Compiler and compiler flags
F90 ?= gfortran
F90FLAGS ?=
# Relative path of wrapper libraries in PSyclone (overwrite for custom location)
PSYDATA_LIB_DIR ?= .
