# Kernel Extraction Library Using NetCDF for LFRic

This wrapper library [writes (extracts)](
https://psyclone.readthedocs.io/en/stable/psyke.html) input and output
parameters of instrumented code regions to a [NetCDF file](
https://psyclone.readthedocs.io/en/stable/psyke.html#netcdf-extraction-example)
using the LFRic infrastructure library. A stand-alone driver can then be
used to rerun this specific code region and verify the results (or
compare performance).

## Dependencies

This library uses the [PSyData API](
https://psyclone.readthedocs.io/en/stable/psy_data.html) to interface with
the application. The following dependencies must be available:

- The LFRic infrastructure library. A pared-down version of LFRic
  infrastructure is located in the PSyclone repository (see e.g.
  [LFRic Example 17](
  https://github.com/stfc/PSyclone/tree/master/examples/lfric/eg17), however
  it is not included in the PSyclone [installation](
  ./../../../README.md#installation). See the [LFRic API](
  https://psyclone.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dynamo0p3.html) documentation
  for information on how to obtain access to the LFRic code.

- This library uses NetCDF to store the data, so NetCDF must
  be available on the system. NetCDF development packages are available via
  the Linux package manager. Otherwise they can be built from source that
  can be downloaded from the [UCAR NetCDF website](
  https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf). For more information please
  refer to the [hands-on practicals documentation](
  https://github.com/stfc/PSyclone/tree/master/tutorial/practicals#netcdf-library-lfric-examples).

- The ExtractNetcdf (``extract_netcdf_base.jinja``) and PSyData
  (``psy_data_base.jinja``) base classes, which are included in PSyclone
  installation. These Jinja templates are processed to create the
  code to write ``integer``, 32- and 64-bit ``real`` scalars, and 1, 2, 3,
  and 4-dimensional ``real`` and ``integer`` arrays. The generated Fortran
  modules, ``extract_netcdf_base.f90`` and ``psy_data_base.f90``, are then
  used by the supplied NetCDF-kernel-extraction module,
  ``kernel_data_netcdf.f90``, to create the wrapper library.

## Compilation

The library is compiled with ``make`` using the provided ``Makefile``. The
environment variables ``$F90`` and ``$F90FLAGS`` can be set to point to the
[Fortran compiler](./../../../README.md#compilation) and flags to use. They
default to ``gfortran`` and the empty string.

The library can be compiled with MPI support, which will add the process rank
to each output filename, by setting ``MPI=yes``:

```shell
MPI=yes make
```

It uses ``NO_MPI`` as a preprocessor directive, which is what the LFRic build
environment uses, so the source files can be copied into the LFRic build, and
will automatically be using MPI (or not), depending on compilation options used
for LFRic. In order to support MPI in extraction (which means each process will write
its own output data by appending its rank to the filename), set the environment
variable ``MPI=yes`` before starting the build process (which will make sure
that ``NO_MPI`` is not set).

The NetCDF helper program ``nf-config`` is used to get the NetCDF-specific
include paths. By default it is set to the relative path to the pared-down
LFRic infrastructure located in a clone of PSyclone repository,
``<PSYCLONEHOME>/src/psyclone/tests/test_files/dynamo0p3/infrastructure``.
This is not available in the PSyclone [installation](
./../../../README.md#installation) so the exact path
**must be specified** using the environment variable ``LFRIC_INF_DIR``, e.g.

```shell
F90=ifort F90FLAGS="-g -check bounds" LFRIC_INF_DIR=<path/to/LFRic/code> make
```

It is the responsibility of the user to make sure that the module files
used when compiling the LFRic extraction library are identical to the ones
used when running an LFRic application.

The locations of the ExtractNetcdf and PSyData base classes are
specified using the environment variables ``$LIB_TMPLT_DIR`` and
``$PSYDATA_LIB_DIR``, respectively. They default to the relative paths to
the [``lib/extract/netcdf``](./../) and top-level [``lib``](./../../../)
directories.

The compilation process will create the wrapper library
``lib_extract.a``. The ``Makefile`` will compile the LFRic
infrastructure library, ``liblfric_netcdf.a``, if required, with the
previously selected compiler flags.

Similar to compilation of the [examples](
https://psyclone.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html#compilation), the
compiled wrapper library can be removed by running ``make clean``. To also
remove the compiled infrastructure library it is necessary to run
``make allclean`` (this is especially important if changing compilers
or compiler flags).

### Linking the wrapper library

The application needs to provide the parameters to link in this
NetCDF-kernel-extraction library, ``_kernel_data_netcdf``, the LFRic
infrastructure library, ``lfric_netcdf``, and the required NetCDF
parameters when compiling and linking. For instance:

```shell
$(F90)  ... -L$(PSYDATA_LIB_DIR)/extract/netcdf/lfric -l_kernel_data_netcdf \
        -L$(LFRIC_INF_DIR) -llfric_netcdf $(LFRIC_SPECIFIC_LINKING_PARAMETERS) \
        $(nf-config --flibs)
```

### Note

Certain versions of Fedora have a broken ``nf-config`` script. In
this case the ``Makefile`` has to be modified to provide the required
information (you can try to see if ``nc-config`` can be used,
or you have to explicitly provide the required paths and options).
