# This Makefile just creates the Fortran base class for the compare_variables_mod
# from the jinja template `compare_variables_mod.jinja`. The compile functionality
# it offers is only meant for testing, each domain=specific library should compile
# its own version (with therefore consistent preprocessing and compiler settings).

# ----------- Default "make" values, can be overwritten by the user -----------
# Compiler and compiler flags

F90FLAGS ?=
# Path to the PSyclone wrapper libraries. It defaults to the relative path to
# the top-level 'lib' directory. Overwrite for a custom location.
PSYDATA_LIB_DIR ?= ./..

# These arguments are responsible for creating the Fortran
# `compare_variables_mod` file based on the jinja template. It will support
# the listed data types and scalar and 2-dimensional arrays. Note that
# domain-specific implementation will create their own version with different
# number of dimensions if required.
