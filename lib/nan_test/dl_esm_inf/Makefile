# export F90=mpif90
# export F90FLAGS="-O3"
# export AR=ar

# It also uses nf-config to query for flags required for NetCDF compilation.

# Dependencies:
# -------------
# Compilation of nan_test needs the .mod file from dl_esm_inf,
# the base class nan_test_base (which in turn needs psy_data_base).

# Rules for file creation
# -----------------------
%.o: %.f90
	$(F90) $(F90FLAGS) -c $<

# The dl_esm_inf NAN-test library is built on the psy-data base library
# and the NAN-test base library. So add the rules to process
# these files to get the plain Fortran files:
psy_data_base.f90: ../../psy_data_base.jinja Makefile
	$(PROCESS) $(PROCESS_ARGS) $< > psy_data_base.f90

nan_test_base.f90: ../nan_test_base.jinja Makefile
	$(PROCESS) $(PROCESS_ARGS) $< > nan_test_base.f90

# The dl_esm_inf library
$(INF_LIB):
	$(MAKE) -C $(INF_DIR) F90=$(F90)

clean:
	rm -f *.o *.mod $(LIB_NAME) psy_data_base.* nan_test_base.*
