!> This module implements a PSyData-based verification that floating point
!! input and output parameters are not NAN and not infinite for the
!! dl_esm_inf library. It is based on the NANTestBaseType (from which it
!! inherits the handling of the basic Fortran data types and 2d-arrays,
!! as specified in the Makefile). It adds the support for the
!! dl_esm_inf-specific field type.
