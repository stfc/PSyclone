# environment variables. e.g.:
# 
# export F90=mpif90
# export F90FLAGS="-O3"
# export AR=ar

#TODO: #813 keeps track of adding enough files from LFRic to PSyclone to be
#      able to compile this library without the need of external
#      files (or #745, which will try to create a stand-alone example).

# This directory points to an external, compiled version of the LFRic,
# which is required to find the module files when compiling this library:
LFRIC_DIR ?= ../../../src/psyclone/tests/test_files/dynamo0p3/infrastructure/
LFRIC_LIB=$(LFRIC_DIR)/liblfric.a

# The LFRic ReadOnly library needs the PreDeclareVariable() and
# ProvideVariable() routines for the basic Fortran types real, int,
# and double, and for 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-dimensional arrays. These arguments
# are used for both base classes: PSyDataBase and ReadOnlyBase to ensure
# consistent code creation.
