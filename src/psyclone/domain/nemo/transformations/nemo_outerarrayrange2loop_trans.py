'''Module providing a transformation from an Assignment node
containing an Array Reference node in its left-hand-side which in turn
has at least one PSyIR Range node specifying an access to an array
index (equivalent to an array assignment statement in Fortran) to the
equivalent loop representation using a NemoLoop node. The outermost
Range is chosen to be replaced as replacing any other Range node would
result in a reordering of the array accesses.

        node if the node is an Assignment and the left-hand-side of

        the case then the outermost Range nodes within array
        references within the assignment are replaced with references
        to a loop index. A NemoLoop loop (with the same loop index) is
        also placed around the modified assignment statement.

        The name of the loop index is taken from the PSyclone
        configuration file if a name exists for the particular array
        index, otherwise a new name is generated. The bounds of the
        loop are taken from the Range node if they are provided. If
        not, the loop bounds are taken from the PSyclone configuration
        file if bounds values are supplied. If not, the LBOUND or
        UBOUND intrinsics are used as appropriate. The type of the
        NemoLoop is also taken from the configuration file if it is
        supplied for that index, otherwise it is specified as being
        "unknown".
