'''Module providing a transformation that given an Assignment node to an

    '''Transformation that given an assignment with an ArrayReference Range
    in the LHS (equivalent to an array assignment statement in Fortran), it
    converts it to an explicit loop doing each of the individual element
    assignments separately. For example:

    >>> from psyclone.parse.algorithm import parse

    >>> api = "nemo"
    >>> filename = "tra_adv.F90" # examples/nemo/code

    The specified Range node must be the outermost Range (specifying
    an access to an array index) within an Array Reference and the
    array reference must be on the left-hand-side of an Assignment
    node. This is required for correctness and if not satisfied the
    transformation will raise an exception.

    By default the transformation will reject character arrays,
    though this can be overriden by setting the
    allow_string option to True. Note that PSyclone expresses syntax such
    as `character(LEN=100)` as UnsupportedFortranType, and this
    transformation will convert unknown or unsupported types to loops.

        The Range node is provided to the apply method of the transformation
        to indicate which array index should be transformed. This can only
        be applied to the outermost Range of the ArrayReference.
