'''Module providing a transformation from an Assignment node
containing an Array Reference node in its left-hand-side which in turn
has at least one PSyIR Range node specifying an access to an array
index (equivalent to an array assignment statement in Fortran) to the
equivalent loop representation using the required number of NemoLoop
nodes.

        '''Apply the NemoAllArrayRange2Loop transformation to the specified
        node if the node is an Assignment and the left-hand-side of
        the assignment is an Array Reference containing at least one
        Range node specifying an access to an array index. If this is
        the case then all Range nodes within array references within
        the assignment are replaced with references to the appropriate
        loop indices. The appropriate number of NemoLoop loops are
        also placed around the modified assignment statement.

        The name of each loop index is taken from the PSyclone
        configuration file if a name exists for the particular array
        index, otherwise a new name is generated. The bounds of each
        loop are taken from the Range node if they are provided. If
        not, the loop bounds are taken from the PSyclone configuration
        file if a bounds value is supplied. If not, the LBOUND or
        UBOUND intrinsics are used as appropriate. The type of the
        NemoLoop is also taken from the configuration file if it is
        supplied for that index, otherwise it is specified as being
        "unknown".

        :param options: a dictionary with options for transformations. No
            options are used in this transformation. This is an optional
            argument that defaults to None.
        :param bool options["verbose"]: whether to print out the reason
            why the inner transformation was not applied. This is useful
            because this transfomation succeeds even if one of the inner
            transformations fails, and therefor the reason why the inner
            transformation failed is not propagated.
        :type options: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
        :param bool options["allow_string"]: whether to allow the
            transformation on a character type array range. Defaults to False.
