'''Module providing a transformation that transforms a constant index
access to an array (i.e. one that does not contain a loop iterator) to
a single trip loop. The node representing the constant index access is
provided to the apply method of the transformation to indicate which
array index should be transformed.

        '''Apply the NemoArrayAccess2Loop transformation if the supplied node
        is an access to an array index within an Array Reference that
        is on the left-hand-side of an Assignment node. The access
        must be a scalar (i.e. not a range) and must not include a
        loop variable (as we are transforming a single access to a
        loop).

        These constraints are required for correctness and an
        exception will be raised if they are not satisfied. If the
        constraints are satisfied then the array access is replaced
        with a loop iterator and a single trip loop.

        The new loop will be placed immediately around the assignment
        i.e. it will not take into account any expected nesting (ji,
        jj, jk etc) constraints. Loop re-ordering should be performed by
        a separate transformation.

        The name of the loop index is taken from the PSyclone
        configuration file if a name exists for the particular array
        index, otherwise a new name is generated.
