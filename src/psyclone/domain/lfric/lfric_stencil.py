''' This module implements the PSyclone Dynamo 0.3 API by 1)
    specialising the required base classes in parser.py (KernelType) and
    adding a new class (DynFuncDescriptor03) to capture function descriptor
    metadata and 2) specialising the required base classes in psyGen.py
    (PSy, Invokes, Invoke, InvokeSchedule, Loop, Kern, Inf, Arguments and
    Argument). '''
