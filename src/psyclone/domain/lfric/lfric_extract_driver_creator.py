class LFRicExtractDriverCreator:
    '''This class provides the functionality to create a driver that
    reads in extracted data produced by using the PSyData kernel-extraction
    functionality.

    The driver is created as follows:

    1. The corresponding :py:class:`psyclone.psyGen.Invoke` statement that
       contains the kernel(s) is copied. This way we avoid affecting the tree
       of the caller. We need the invoke since it contains the symbol table.
    2. We remove all halo exchange nodes. For now, the extract transformation
       will not work when distributed memory is enabled, but since this
       restriction is expected to be lifted, the code to handle this is
       already added.
    3. We lower each kernel (child of the invoke) that was requested to
       be extracted, all others are removed. This is required since the kernel
       extraction will not contain the required data for the other kernels to
       be called. The lowering is important to fix the variable names for the
       loop boundaries of the :py:class:`psyclone.domain.lfric.LFRicLoop`: the
       loop start/stop expressions (`loop0_start` etc.) depend on the position
       of the loop in the tree. For example, if there are two kernels, they
       will be using `loop0_start` and `loop1_start`. If only the second is
       extracted, the former second (and now only) loop would be using
       `loop0_start` without lowering, but the kernel extraction would have
       written the values for `loop1_start`.
    4. We create a program for the driver with a new symbol table and start
       adding symbols for the program unit, precision symbols, PSyData read
       module etc to it.
    5. We add all required symbols to the new symbol table. The copied tree
       will still rely on the symbol table in the original PSyIR, so the
       symbols must be declared in the symbol table of the driver program.
       This is done by replacing all references in the extracted region with
       new references, which use new symbols which are declared in the driver
       symbol table.

       a. We first handle all non user-defined type. We can be certain that
          these symbols are already unique (since it's the original kernel
          code).
       b. Then we handle user-defined types. Since we only use basic Fortran
          types, accesses to these types need to be 'flattened': an access
          like ``a%b%c`` will be flattened to ``a_b_c`` to create a valid
          symbol name without needing the user-defined type. We use the
          original access string (``a%b%c``) as tag, since we know this tag
          is unique, and create a new, unique symbol based on ``a_b_c``. This
          takes care if the user should be using this newly generated name
          (e.g. if the user uses ``a%b%c`` and ``a_b_c``, ``a_b_c`` as non
          user defined symbol will be added to the symbol table first. When
          then ``a%b%c`` is flattened, the symbol table will detect that the
          symbol ``a_b_c`` already exists and create ``a_b_c_1`` for the tag
          ``a%b%c``). For known LFRic types, the actual name used in a
          reference will be changed to the name the user expects. For example,
          if field ``f`` is used, the access will be ``f_proxy%data``. The
          kernel extraction does the same and stores the values under the name
          ``f``, so the driver similarly simplifies the name back to the
          original ``f``.
          The :py:class:`psyclone.domain.lfric.KernCallArgList` class will
          have enforced the appropriate basic Fortran type declaration for
          each reference to a user defined variable. For example, if a field
          ``f`` is used, the reference to ``f_proxy%data`` will have a data
          type attribute of a 1D real array (with the correct precision).

    6. We create the code for reading in all of the variables in the input-
       and output-lists. Mostly, no special handling of argument type is
       required (since the generic interface will make sure to call the
       appropriate function). But in case of user-defined types, we need to
       use the original names with '%' when calling the functions for reading
       in data, since this is the name that was used when creating the data
       file. For example, the name of a parameter like
       ``f_proxy%local_stencil`` will be stored in the data file with the
       '%' notation (which is also the tag used for the symbol). So when
       reading the values in the driver, we need to use the original name
       (or tag) with '%', but the values will be stored in a flattened
       variable. For example, the code created might be:
       `call extract_psy_data%ReadVariable('f_proxy%local_stencil',
       fproxy_local_stencil)`

       a. Input variables are read in using functions from the PSyData
          ``ReadKernelData`` module. These function will allocate all array
          variables to the right size based on the data from the input file.
       b. For parameters that are read and written, two variables will be
          declared: the input will be stored in the unmodified variable name,
          and the output values in a variable with ``_post`` appended. For
          example, a field ``f`` as input will be read into ``f`` using the
          name ``f``, and output values will be read into ``f_post`` using
          the name ``f_post``. The symbol table will make sure that the
          ``_post`` name is unique.
       c. Similar to b., output only parameters will be read into a variable
          named with '_post' attached, e.g. output field ``f`` will be stored
          in a variable ``f_post``. Then the array ``f`` is allocated based on
          the shape of ``f_post`` and initialised to 0 (since it's an
          output-only parameter the value doesn't really matter).

    7. The extracted kernels are added to the program. Since in step 5 all
       references have been replaced, the created code will use the correct
       new variable names (which just have been read in). The output variables
       with ``_post`` attached will not be used at all so far.
    8. After the kernel calls are executed, each output variable is compared
       with the value stored in the corresponding ``_post`` variable. For
       example, a variable ``f`` which was modified in the kernel call(s),
       will then be compared with ``f_post``.
