        '''This method detects if a variable is used as an array or not.
        If available, it will use the access information, i.e. how the
        variable is used (e.g. if it has indices somewhere, like `a(i)%b`).
        This can be incorrect in case of implicit loops (e.g. `a=b+1`,
        where `a` and `b` are arrays) where the variable usage information
        will not have information about indices. In this case this function
        will fallback to querying the symbol itself.

        This can cause significant slowdown if this symbol is imported
        from a module, since then these modules need to be parsed.
        # TODO #1213: Parsing modules is not yet supported.

        If a `loop_variable` is specified, a variable access will only be
        considered an array access if the specified variable is used in
        at least one of the indices. For example:
        >>> do i=1, n
        >>>     a(j) = 2

        the access to `a` is not considered an array if `loop_variable` is
        set to `i`. If `loop_variable` is specified, `access_information`
        must be specified.

        :param str index_variable: optional loop variable that is used to \
            to determine if an access is an array access using this variable.
        :param access_info: variable access information, optional.
