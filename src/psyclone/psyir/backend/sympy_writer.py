class SymPyWriter(FortranWriter):
    '''Implements a PSyIR-to-SymPy writer, which is used to create a
    representation of the PSyIR tree that can be understood by SymPy. Most
    Fortran expressions work as expected without modification. This class
    implements special handling for constants (which can have a precision
    attached, e.g. 2_4) and some intrinsic functions (e.g. ``MAX``, which SymPy
    expects to be ``Max``). Array accesses are converted into functions (while
    SymPy supports indexed expression, they cannot be used as expected when
    solving, SymPy does not solve component-wise - ``M[x]-M[1]`` would not
    result in ``x=1``, while it does for SymPy unknown functions).
    Array expressions are supported by the writer: it will convert any array
    expression like ``a(i:j:k)`` by using three arguments: ``a(i, j, k)``.
    Then simple array accesses like ``b(i,j)`` are converted to
    ``b(i,i,1,j,j,1)``. Similarly, if ``a`` is known to be an array, then the
    writer will use ``a(sympy_lower,sympy_upper,1)``. This makes sure all SymPy
    unknown functions that represent an array use the same number of
    arguments.

    The simple use case of converting a (list of) PSyIR expressions to SymPy
    expressions is as follows::

        symp_expr_list = SymPyWriter(exp1, exp2, ...)

    If additional functionality is required (access to the type map or
    to convert a potentially modified SymPy expression back to PSyIR), an
    instance of SymPy writer must be created::

        writer = SymPyWriter()
        symp_expr_list = writer([exp1, exp2, ...])

    It additionally supports accesses to structure types. A full description
    can be found in the manual:

        '''This function creates a dictionary mapping each access in any
        of the expressions to either a SymPy Function (if the reference
        is an array reference) or a Symbol (if the reference is not an
        array reference). It defines a new SymPy function for each array,
        which has a special write method implemented that automatically
        converts array indices back by combining each three arguments into
        one expression (i. e. ``a(1,9,2)`` would become ``a(1:9:2)``).

        An access like ``a(i)%b(j)`` is mapped to a function named ``a_b``
        with arguments ``(i,i,1,j,j,1)`` (also handling name clashes in case
        that the user code already contains a symbol ``a_b``). The SymPy
        function created for this new symbol will store the original signature
        and the number of indices for each member (so in the example above
        that would be ``Signature("a%b")`` and ``(1,1)``. This information
        is sufficient to convert the SymPy symbol back to the correct Fortran
        representation.

        A new symbol table is created any time this function is called, so
        it is important to provide all expressions at once for the symbol
        table to avoid name clashes in any expression.

        This function also handles reserved names like 'lambda' which might
        occur in one of the Fortran expressions. These reserved names must be
        renamed (otherwise SymPy parsing, which uses ``eval`` internally,
        fails). A symbol table is used which is initially filled with all
        reserved names. Then for each reference accounted, a unique name is
        generated using this symbol table - so if the reference is a reserved
        name, a new name will be created (e.g. ``lambda`` might become
        ``lambda_1``). The SymPyWriter (e.g. in ``reference_node``) will
        use the renamed value when creating the string representation.

        The optional identical_variables dictionary can contain information
        about variables which are known to be the same. For example, if
        `identical_variables={'i': 'j'}`, then 'i+1' and 'j+1' will be
        considered equal.

        The optional `all_variables_positive` flag can be used to indicate that
        all variables are positive definite. This means that, e.g. 'i+j' will
        be considered greater than 'i'.

        :param list_of_expressions: the list of expressions from which all
            references are taken and added to a symbol table to avoid
            renaming any symbols (so that only member names will be renamed).
