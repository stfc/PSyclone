'''PSyIR frontend to convert a SymPy expression to PSyIR
'''


from psyclone.psyir.frontend.fortran import FortranReader


class SymPyReader():
    '''This class converts a SymPy expression, that was created by the
    SymPyWriter, back to PSyIR. It basically allows to use SymPy to modify
    PSyIR expressions:

        1. The SymPyWriter converts the Fortran expression to SymPy
        2. SymPy is used to manipulate these mathematical expressions
        3. The SymPyReader is used to convert these SymPy expressions back
           into PSyIR (from which source code can be recreated)

    Most SymPy expressions can be parsed as Fortran expression immediately,
    but the big exception to this are Fortran Arrays which must be able to
    support array expressions like ``a(1:5:2)``. As outlined in the
    SymPyWriter, each array is represented as an UndefinedFunction in SymPy,
    and each each dimension of the Fortran array will provide three
    arguments to this function: the start, stop, and step value. So the
    expression above will be converted to ``a(1,5,2)``, and ``a(7)`` will
    be represented as ``a(7:7:1)``. If the start- or stop-expression is
    not specified, e.g. ``a(:)``, the SymPy writer will use two special
    symbols ``sympy_lower`` and ``sympy_upper``, e.g. the above expression
    will become ``a(sympy_lower:sympy_upper:1)``. The SymPyWriter will
    change the name if required in case of a name clash (i.e. if the user
    declared a variable called ``sympy_lower`` etc).

    The task of the SymPy reader is to convert these expressions back to
    the original PSyIR representation. For example, the SymPy expressions
    ``a(i,j,k)`` will be written as ``a(i:j:k)``. This conversion is done
    by the function ``print_fortran_array`` by combining each 3-tuple of
    arguments back to the corresponding Fortran representation.

    The SymPyWriter sets the ``_sympystr`` attribute of the SymPy
    UndefinedFunction it creates to ``print_fortran_array``. The ``_sympystr``
    method is automatically called by SymPy when converting an expression
    into a string.

    In order to achieve this, the SymPyReader must know the names used for
    the lower- and upper-bounds. The constructor takes a SymPyWriter as
    argument in order to get the name of these bounds. It is important that
    the SymPyWriter provided here is the one that was used to create the SymPy
    expressions in the first place.

    :param sympy_writer: the SymPyWriter that was used to create the SymPy
        expressions.
    :type sympy_writer: :py:class:`psyclone.psyir.backend.SymPyWriter`

    '''
    # The default values for the bounds, they will be changed to the
    # correct values in the constructor.

    _upper_bound = "sympy_upper"
