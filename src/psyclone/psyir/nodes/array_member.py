        Construct an ArrayMember instance describing an array access to a
        member of a structure.

        e.g. for the Fortran `grid%subdomains(1,2)`, `subdomains` must be an
        array and we are accessing element (1,2) of it. We would therefore
        create the ArrayMember for this access by calling:

        >>> amem = ArrayMember.create("subdomains",

            is being accessed.
        :param indices: the array-index expressions.
        :type indices: list of :py:class:`psyclone.psyir.nodes.DataNode` or
            :py:class:`psyclone.psyir.nodes.Range`

        :raises GenerationError: if the supplied `indices` argument is not \
                                 a list.
