    ''' Abstract class used to compute data sharing attributes about variables

        The PSyIR does not specify if each symbol inside an OpenMP region is
        private, firstprivate, shared or shared but needs synchronisation,
        the attributes are inferred looking at the usage of each symbol inside
        the parallel region.

        This method analyses the directive body and automatically classifies
        each symbol using the following rules:
        - All arrays are shared unless listed in the explicitly private list.
        - Scalars that are accessed only once are shared.
        - Scalars that are read-only or written outside a loop are shared.
        - Scalars written in multiple iterations of a loop are private, unless:

            * there is a write-after-read dependency in a loop iteration,
              in this case they are shared but need synchronisation;
            * they are read before in the same parallel region (but not inside
              the same loop iteration), in this case they are firstprivate.
            * they are only conditionally written in some iterations;
              in this case they are firstprivate.

        This method returns the sets of private, firstprivate, and shared but
        needing synchronisation symbols, all symbols not in these sets are
        assumed shared. How to synchronise the symbols in the third set is
        up to the caller of this method.

        :returns: three set of symbols that classify each of the symbols in
                  the directive body as PRIVATE, FIRSTPRIVATE or SHARED NEEDING
                  SYNCHRONISATION.
