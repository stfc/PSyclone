        Given the name of a structure member of a structure and a Member
        node describing the access to a component of it, construct a
        StructureMember.

        e.g. if we had the following Fortran access: grid%subdomain%xstart
        then 'subdomain' must itself be of structure type and we are accessing
        the 'xstart' component of it. We would therefore create the
        `StructureMember` for this by calling:

        >>> smem = StructureMember.create("subdomain", Member("xstart"))
