        Create a reference to a member of one or more elements of an array of
        structures.

        The symbol to be referred to must be of DeferredType, UnknownType or
        ArrayType. If the latter then the 'intrinsic' type of the array must
        be specified with a TypeSymbol. The member of the
        structure that is accessed is specified using the 'members'
        argument. e.g. for a reference to "field(idx)%bundle(2)%flag" this
        argument would be [("bundle", [Literal("2", INTEGER4_TYPE)]), "flag"].
        The 'indices' argument specifies the DataNodes describing the indexing
        into the array of structures. For the example given previously, this
        would be [Reference(idx_symbol)] where `idx_symbol` is the Symbol
        representing the `idx` variable in the Fortran code snippet.

        :param indices: a list of Nodes describing the array indices.
        :type indices: list of :py:class:`psyclone.psyir.nodes.Node`
        :param members: one or more component(s) of the structure(s) that \
            make up the full access. Any components that are array \
            references must provide the name of the array and a list of \
            DataNodes describing which part of it is accessed.
        :type members: list of str or 2-tuples containing (str, \
            list of nodes describing array access)
