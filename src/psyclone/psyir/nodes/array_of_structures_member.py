        Create an access to a member of one or more elements of an array of
        structures that is itself a member of a structure.

        e.g. if we had the Fortran `grid%subdomains(1)%xstart` then
        `subdomains` must be an array of structure (derived) type. We would
        construct an ArrayOfStructuresMember for this access by calling:

        >>> aosmem = ArrayOfStructuresMember.create(
                "subdomains", [Literal("1", INTEGER_TYPE)], Member("xstart"))

        :param str member_name: the name of the array member of the structure \
            that is being accessed.
        :param indices: the array-index expressions.
        :type indices: list of :py:class:`psyclone.psyir.nodes.DataNode`
        :param inner_member: the member of the `member_name` structure that \
            is being accessed.
        :type inner_member: :py:class:`psyclone.psyir.nodes.Member`

        :returns: a new ArrayOfStructuresMember object.
        :rtype: :py:class:`psyclone.psyir.nodes.ArrayOfStructuresMember`
