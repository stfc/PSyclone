'''Module providing a transformation from a PSyIR Array Range to a
PSyIR Loop. This could be useful for e.g. performance reasons, to
allow further transformations e.g. loop fusion or if the back-end does
not support array ranges.

By default the transformation will reject character arrays,
though this can be overriden by setting the
allow_string option to True. Note that PSyclone expresses syntax such
as `character(LEN=100)` as UnsupportedFortranType, and this
transformation will convert unknown or unsupported types to loops.
