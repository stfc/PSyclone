    '''
    Adds an abstract directive (it needs to be specified by sub-classing this
    transformation) to a loop indicating that it should be parallelised. It
    performs some data dependency checks to guarantee that the loop can be
    parallelised without changing the semantics of it.

    If the nowait option is supplied to the apply function, then PSyclone will
    attempt to add the relevant asynchronous option to the directive, if
    supported. If its not supported, or PSyclone's analysis suggests that it
    cannot be launched asynchronously, the transformation will occur as though
    the nowait option was not supplied. If the asynchronous option is added,
    PSyclone will also generate a corresponding barrier before the next
    dependent statement.
