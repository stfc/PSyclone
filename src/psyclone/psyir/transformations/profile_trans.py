'''This module provides the Profile transformation.

class ProfileTrans(PSyDataTrans):
    ''' Create a profile region around a list of statements. For
    example:

    >>> from psyclone.parse.algorithm import parse
    >>> from psyclone.parse.utils import ParseError
    >>> from psyclone.psyGen import PSyFactory, GenerationError
    >>> from psyclone.psyir.transformations import ProfileTrans
    >>> api = "gocean1.0"
    >>> filename = "nemolite2d_alg.f90"
    >>> ast, invokeInfo = parse(filename, api=api, invoke_name="invoke")
    >>> psy = PSyFactory(api).create(invokeInfo)
    >>>
    >>> p_trans = ProfileTrans()

    >>> schedule = psy.invokes.get('invoke_0').schedule
    >>> schedule.view()
    >>>
    >>> # Enclose all children within a single profile region
    >>> newschedule, _ = p_trans.apply(schedule.children)
    >>> newschedule.view()

    This implementation relies completely on the base class PSyDataTrans
    for the actual work, it only adjusts the name etc, and the list
    of valid nodes.

    '''
    # Unlike other transformations we can be fairly relaxed about the nodes
    # that a region can contain as we don't have to understand them.
