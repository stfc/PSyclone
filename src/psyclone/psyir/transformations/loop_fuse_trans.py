class LoopFuseTrans(LoopTrans):
    ''' Provides a generic loop-fuse transformation to two Nodes in the
    PSyIR of a Schedule after performing validity checks for the supplied
    Nodes. Examples are given in the descriptions of any children classes.

    If loops have different named loop variables, when possible the loop
    variable of the second loop will be renamed to be the same as the first
    loop. This has the side effect that the second loop's variable will no
    longer have its value modified, with the expectation that that value
    isn't used anymore.

    Note that the validation of this transformation still has several
    shortcomings, especially for domain API loops. Use at your own risk.
