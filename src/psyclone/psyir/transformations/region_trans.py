    This abstract class is a base class for all transformations that act
    on a list of nodes. It gives access to a validate function that
    makes sure that the nodes in the list are in the same order as in
    the original AST, no node is duplicated, and that all nodes have
    the same parent. We also check that all nodes to be enclosed are
    valid for this transformation - this requires that the sub-class
    populate the `excluded_node_types` tuple.

        The parameter for any of those transformations is either a single
        node, a schedule, or a list of nodes. This function converts this
        into a list of nodes according to the parameter type. This function
        will always return a copy, to avoid issues e.g. if a child list
        of a node should be provided, and a transformation changes the order
        in this list (which would then also change the order of the
