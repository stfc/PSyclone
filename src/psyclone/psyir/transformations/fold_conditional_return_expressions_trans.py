class FoldConditionalReturnExpressionsTrans(Transformation):
    ''' Provides a transformation that folds conditional expressions with only
    a return statement inside so that the Return statement is moved to the end
    of the Routine and therefore it can be safely removed. This simplifies the
    control flow of the kernel to facilitate other transformations like kernel
    fusions. For example, the following code:

    .. code-block:: fortran

        subroutine test(i)
            if (i < 5) then
                return
            endif
            if (i > 10) then
                return
            endif
            ! CODE
        end subroutine

    will be transformed to:

    .. code-block:: fortran

        subroutine test(i)
            if (.not.(i < 5)) then
                if (.not.(i > 10)) then
                    ! CODE
                endif
            endif
