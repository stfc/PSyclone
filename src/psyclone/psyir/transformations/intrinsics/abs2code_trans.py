'''Module providing a transformation from a PSyIR ABS operator to
PSyIR code. This could be useful if the ABS operator is not supported
by the back-end or if the performance in the inline code is better
than the intrinsic.

    The transformation replaces

    with the following logic:

    .. code-block:: python

        IF X < 0.0:
