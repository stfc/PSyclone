'''Module providing a transformation from a PSyIR MATMUL operator to
PSyIR code. This could be useful if the MATMUL operator is not
supported by the back-end or if the performance in the inline code is
better than the intrinsic. MATMUL supports both matrix multiply and
matrix vector multiply. At the moment this transformation is limited
to matrix vector multiply.
