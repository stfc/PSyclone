'''Module providing a transformation from a PSyIR SIGN operator to
PSyIR code. This could be useful if the SIGN operator is not supported
by the back-end or if the performance of the inline code is better
than the intrinsic.

    with the following logic:

    .. code-block:: python

        R = ABS(A)

            R = R*-1.0

        expressions, ``...`` could be arbitrary PSyIR code and where
        ``ABS`` has been replaced with inline code by the NemoAbsTrans
        transformation.

        This transformation requires the operation node to be a
        descendent of an assignment and will raise an exception if
        this is not the case.
