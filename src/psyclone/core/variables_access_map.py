        If the `component_indices` parameter is not an instance of
        `ComponentIndices`, it is used to construct an instance. Therefore it
        can be None, a list or a list of lists of PSyIR nodes. In the case of
        a list of lists, this will be used unmodified to construct the
        ComponentIndices structures. If it is a simple list, it is assumed
        that it contains the indices used in accessing the last component
        of the signature. For example, for `a%b` with
        `component_indices=[i,j]`, it will create `[[], [i,j]` as component
        indices, indicating that no index is used in the first component `a`.
        If the access is supposed to be for `a(i)%b(j)`, then the
        `component_indices` argument must be specified as a list of lists,
        i.e. `[[i], [j]]`.
