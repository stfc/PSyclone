!> @brief Broken meta-data for the LFRic built-in operations.
!> @details This meta-data is purely to provide PSyclone with a
!> specification of each operation.
!!         This specification is used for correctness checking as well as
!!         to enable optimisations of invokes containing calls to
!!         built-in operations.
!!         The actual implementation of these built-ins is
!!         generated by PSyclone (hence the empty ..._code routines in
!!         this file).
