# LFRic Infrastructure Library

This directory contains a heavily modified version of the
LFRic infrastructure library. Some files are used when
running compilation tests with ``pytest``, and the whole library
is used to implement a standalone LFRic example that can
be executed.

TODO #968: the copyright statements might need to be updated.

## Usage in ``pytest``
The file ``<PSYCLONEHOME>/src/psyclone/tests/lfric_build.py`` contains
the list of files required for compilation testing (see
INFRASTRUCTURE_MODULES). These files will be compiled by each process,
and then used for all compilation tests.

## Usage in LFRic standalone example
The LFRic standalone examples (``<PSYCLONEHOME>/examples/lfric/``) use
this library and will trigger a compilation if required.
The makefile provides two targets:

```shell
make standalone
```
will compile a standalone version ``liblfric.a`` with no additional
dependencies. It will use existing unit-tests in the infrastructure
modules to define the required data structures.

```shell
make netcdf
```
will add support for reading in meshes using NetCDF in a library
``liblfric_netcdf.a``. Access to ``nf-config`` is required to
detect the required settings. When this library is used you
have to link in NetCDF after ``liblfric_netcdf.a``.
