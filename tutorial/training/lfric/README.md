# PSyclone's LFRic Domain
PSyclone was originally developed for the UK Met Office's
new numerical weather prediction system LFRic.
This session introduces the ``LFRic`` API.

## 4.2-openmp
This section shows how to apply OpenMP parallelisation for a
simple LFRic example code.

## 4.4-colouring-openmp
This section shows a standard LFRic transformation that allows
to use multi-threaded parallelism in loops with shared
accesses.
