'''A simple transformation script for the introduction of OpenMP with PSyclone.
In order to use it you must first install PSyclone. See README.md in the
top-level psyclone directory.

Once you have PSyclone installed, this script may be used by doing:

 >>> psyclone -s ./omp_levels_trans.py traldf_iso.F90

This should produce a lot of output, ending with generated
Fortran.
'''

from psyclone.transformations import OMPLoopTrans, OMPParallelTrans
from psyclone.psyir.nodes import Loop

# Set up some loop_type inference rules in order to reference useful domain
# loop constructs by name
Loop.set_loop_type_inference_rules({
        "lon": {"variable": "#Add the variable name used in inner loops"},
        "lat": {"variable": "#Add the variable name used in outer loops"},
})


def trans(psyir):
    ''' Transform a specific Schedule by making all loops
    over levels OpenMP parallel.

    :param psyir: the PSyIR of the provided file.
    :type psyir: :py:class:`psyclone.psyir.nodes.FileContainer`

    '''
    omp_parallel = OMPParallelTrans()
    omp_do = OMPLoopTrans()

    # In case of a transformation, the argument psyir is a FileContainer
    print("Filename is", psyir.name)

    # Apply it to each loop over levels containing a kernel
    for loop in psyir.walk(Loop):
        if loop.loop_type == "lat":
            # Apply transformation for outer loops
            omp_do.apply(loop)
        elif loop.loop_type == None and # Check file name before applying
            # Add omp parallel in the time stepping loop
