modify Fortran expression. It first simplifies an expression,

# (since the writer stores information about mapping of
# Fortran names to SymPy names and back, esp. derived types)
# So you need to provide the sympy_writer instance to the
# SymPyReader constructor:

# and provide the symbol table as second parameter:

# `replace_with` on the rhs of the assignment

# Differentiation the second assignment
# -------------------------------------

# all References will have the name 'x'.
