'''Python script intended to be passed to PSyclone's generate()

        # TODO2: Either use walk, then you need to check for
        #  outer loops, or you loop over children of the schedule,
        #  but then you need to check that each child is indeed a loop
        for loop in subroutine.walk(Loop):
            TODO2: check loop.loop_type, or if the child
                   is a loop, then apply loop_offloading

            TODO3: Now you also need to add target_trans around the
                   directive. The ``ancestor`` method is the easiest
                   option (look for the first node of type ``Directive``).
                   Using ``parent`` works, but be aware that there is a
                   ``Schedule`` node, so you would need ``parent.parent``
                target_trans.apply()
