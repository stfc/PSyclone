    "This example describes the structure of the PSyIR and how it may be traversed and searched.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PSyIR is a canonical, language-agnostic, tree-based representation of code. To elaborate: it is 'canonical' in the sense that complex constructs are represented using their constituent parts. e.g. rather than represent `else if` directly in the PSyIR, such a control structure is represented as an `if` within an `else` clause. 'Language agnostic' means that, in principle, the PSyIR may be used to describe code written in any procedural programming language. Thus, language specific constructs (such as Fortran's WHERE) are mapped into generic PSyIR constructs. More details on this may be found in the PSyclone [Developer Guide](https://psyclone-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/psyir.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node in the tree \n",
    "is represented by a (sub-class of) the `Node` [class](https://psyclone-ref.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autogenerated/psyclone.psyir.nodes.html#psyclone.psyir.nodes.Node). As such, every node has the `parent` and `children` attributes as well as those particular to the specialised class. Any sequence of one or more nodes representing statements must have a `Schedule` as parent. Consequently, the bodies of e.g. a subroutine, loop or if statement all have a `Schedule` at their root. All of this is best illustrated by example.\n",
