    "Notice that the code consists of nested loops containing accesses to multi-dimensional arrays. This code structure is typical of finite difference and finite volume codes running on regular meshes and is what the NEMO API expects. If code is written in a different way e.g. with indirection to support irregular meshes, then the NEMO API will not be useful and should not be used."

    "Also notice that the outer loops have indices `jk` with bounds from `1` to `jpk`, the middle loops have indices `jj` with bounds from `1` to `jpj` and the inner loops have indices `ji` with bounds from `1` to `jpi`. The NEMO coding rules enforce this naming convention throughout the code where `ji` corresponds to iterating over longitude, `jj` corresponds to iterating over latitude and `jk` corresponds to iterating over levels. PSyclone uses this naming convention to determine the type of loop. If a different naming scheme is used in a different code then PSyclone can be changed to use these instead. If you are interested you can find the mappings used in the PSyclone [config file](https://github.com/stfc/PSyclone/blob/master/config/psyclone.cfg). See the [user guide](https://psyclone.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html) for more details."

    "As discussed in the tutorial introduction, PSyclone was originally developed to support the concept of 3 separate layers, an Algorithm layer that calls a PSy layer which in turn calls a Kernel layer. The Algorithm and Kernel layers are written by scientists and the PSy layer is generated by PSyclone and contains any parallel code. The Algorithm layer specifies which kernels should be called in regions of code called invoke's. For each invoke PSyclone creates PSy layer code that is called by the algorithm layer and in turn the PSy layer code calls the required kernels.\n",

    "When PSyclone is run it creates a top level `PSy` object which conceptually represents the PSy layer. Within the `PSy` object there are one or more `invoke` objects. Each `invoke` object contains a PSyIR `schedule` which specifies how the PSy layer code will call the required kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the NEMO API we are dealing with existing code so there is no Algorithm, PSy or Kernel layer and there are no invoke regions specified by scientists. The approach taken is to treat the input code as being from a single invoke region (so there is no concept of an Algorithm layer) with the input code representing a pre-existing PSy and Kernel layer mixed together. These layers are then logically separated by specifying that code within loop nests are kernels in the PSyIR.\n",
