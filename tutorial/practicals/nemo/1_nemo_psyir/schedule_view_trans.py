'''A transformation script that simply prints the PSyIR of each invoke
to stdout. No actual transformations are performed.

In order to use this script you must first install PSyclone. See
README.md in the top-level psyclone directory.

Once you have psyclone installed, this may be used by doing:

 $ psyclone -api nemo -s ./schedule_view_trans.py some_source_file.f90

This should produce a lot of output, ending with generated
Fortran. Note that the Fortran source files provided to PSyclone must
have already been preprocessed (if required).
