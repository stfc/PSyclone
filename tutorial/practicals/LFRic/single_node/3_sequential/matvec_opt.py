'''An example PSyclone transformation script to demonstrate
optimisations to the matrix vector kernel to improve its performance
on CPUs. It replaces the matmul Fortran intrinsic with inline matrix
vector code.

This script can be applied via the -s option in the psyclone
command, it is not designed to be directly run from python.
