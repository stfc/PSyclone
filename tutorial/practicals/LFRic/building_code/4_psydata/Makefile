# We want to avoid that a user accidentally starts this Makefile, since then
# unexpected transformations might be applied. So we disable the default
# target here and ask the user to select a different Makefile.
default:
	@echo "Please use one of the transformation-specific Makefiles, e.g."
	@echo "make -f Makefile.extract_one"

# Target for testing the tutorials with compilation (use only one PSyData wrapper)
compile:
	make -f solutions/Makefile.nan_all

# Target for CI, only do the transformation (use all transformation scripts)
transform:
	make clean
